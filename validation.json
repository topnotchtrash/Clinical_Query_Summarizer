        "section": "Dizziness: Dizziness is a term used to describe a range of sensations, such as feeling faint, woozy, weak or unsteady. Dizziness that creates the false sense that you or your surroundings are spinning or moving is called vertigo. Dizziness is one of the more common reasons adults visit their doctors. Frequent dizzy spells or constant dizziness can significantly affect your life. But dizziness rarely signals a life-threatening condition. Treatment of dizziness depends on the cause and your symptoms. It's usually effective, but the problem may recur. People experiencing dizziness may describe it as any of a number of sensations, such as: - A false sense of motion or spinning (vertigo)   - Lightheadedness or feeling faint   - Unsteadiness or a loss of balance   - A feeling of floating, wooziness or heavy-headedness These feelings may be triggered or worsened by walking, standing up or moving your head. Your dizziness may accompanied by nausea or be so sudden or severe that you need to sit or lie down. The episode may last seconds or days and may recur. When to see a doctor Call 911 or seek emergency medical help if you experience dizziness with: - A sudden or severe headache   - Ongoing vomiting   - A sudden change in speech, vision or hearing   - Stumbling or difficulty walking   - Fainting   - Chest pain or an irregular heart rate   - Numbness or weakness   - Shortness of breath   - A high fever   - A very stiff neck   - A head injury   - Seizures Consult with your doctor if you experience recurrent, sudden, severe dizziness or prolonged episodes of dizziness, faintness, lightheadedness or vertigo. Dizziness has many possible causes, including inner ear disturbance, motion sickness and medication effects. Sometimes it's caused by an underlying health condition, such as poor circulation, infection or injury. The way dizziness makes you feel and your triggers provide clues for possible causes. How long the dizziness lasts and any other symptoms you have also help pinpoint the cause. Inner ear problems that cause dizziness (vertigo) Your sense of balance depends on the combined input from the various parts of your sensory system. These include your: - Eyes, which help you determine where your body is in space and how it's moving   - Sensory nerves, which send messages to your brain about body movements and positions   - Inner ear, which houses sensors that help detect gravity and back-and-forth motion Vertigo is the false sense that your surroundings are spinning or moving. With inner ear disorders, your brain receives signals from the inner ear that aren't consistent with what your eyes and sensory nerves are receiving. Vertigo is what results as your brain works to sort out the confusion. - Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV). This condition causes an intense and brief but false sense that you're spinning or moving. These episodes are triggered by a rapid change in head movement, such as when you turn over in bed, sit up or experience a blow to the head. BPPV is the most common cause of vertigo.   - Infection. A viral infection of the vestibular nerve, called vestibular neuritis, can cause intense, constant vertigo. If you also have sudden hearing loss, you may have labyrinthitis.   - Meniere's disease. This disease involves the excessive buildup of fluid in your inner ear. It's characterized by sudden episodes of vertigo lasting as long as several hours. You may also experience fluctuating hearing loss, ringing in the ear and the feeling of a plugged ear.   - Migraine. People who experience migraines may have episodes of vertigo or other types of dizziness even when they're not having a severe headache. Such vertigo episodes can last minutes to hours and may be associated with headache as well as light and noise sensitivity. Circulation problems that cause dizziness You may feel dizzy, faint or off balance if your heart isn't pumping enough blood to your brain. Causes include: - Drop in blood pressure. A dramatic drop in your systolic blood pressure - the higher number in your blood pressure reading - may result in brief lightheadedness or a feeling of faintness. It can occur after sitting up or standing too quickly. This condition is also called orthostatic hypotension.   - Poor blood circulation. Conditions such as cardiomyopathy, heart attack, heart arrhythmia and transient ischemic attack could cause dizziness. And a decrease in blood volume may cause inadequate blood flow to your brain or inner ear. Other causes of dizziness - Neurological conditions. Some neurological disorders - such as Parkinson's disease and multiple sclerosis - can lead to progressive loss of balance.   - Medications. Dizziness can be a side effect of certain medications - such as anti-seizure drugs, antidepressants, sedatives and tranquilizers. In particular, blood pressure lowering medications may cause faintness if they lower your blood pressure too much.   - Anxiety disorders. Certain anxiety disorders may cause lightheadedness or a woozy feeling often referred to as dizziness. These include panic attacks and a fear of leaving home or being in large, open spaces (agoraphobia).   - Low iron levels (anemia). Other signs and symptoms that may occur along with dizziness if you have anemia include fatigue, weakness and pale skin.   - Low blood sugar (hypoglycemia). This condition generally occurs in people with diabetes who use insulin. Dizziness (lightheadedness) may be accompanied by sweating and anxiety.   - Overheating and dehydration. If you're active in hot weather, or if you don't drink enough fluids, you may feel dizzy from overheating (hyperthermia) or from dehydration. This is especially true if you take certain heart medications. Factors that may increase your risk of getting dizzy include: - Age. Older adults are more likely to have medical conditions that cause dizziness, especially a sense of imbalance. They're also more likely to take medications that can cause dizziness.   - A past episode of dizziness. If you've experienced dizziness before, you're more likely to get dizzy in the future. If your doctor suspects you're having or may have had a stroke, are older or suffered a blow to the head, he or she may immediately order an MRI or CT scan. Most people visiting their doctor because of dizziness will first be asked about their symptoms and medications and then be given a physical examination. During this exam, your doctor will check how you walk and maintain your balance and how the major nerves of your central nervous system are working. You may also need a hearing test and balance tests, including: - Eye movement testing. Your doctor may watch the path of your eyes when you track a moving object. And you may be given an eye motion test in which cold and warm water or air are placed in your ear canal. - Head movement testing. If your doctor suspects your vertigo is caused by benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, he or she may do a simple head movement test called the Dix-Hallpike maneuver to verify the diagnosis. - Posturography. This test tells your doctor which parts of the balance system you rely on the most and which parts may be giving you problems. You stand in your bare feet on a platform and try to keep your balance under various conditions. - Rotary-chair testing. During this test you sit in a computer-controlled chair that moves very slowly in a full circle. At faster speeds, it moves back and forth in a very small arc. In addition, you may be given blood tests to check for infection and other tests to check heart and blood vessel health. Dizziness often gets better without treatment. Within a couple of weeks, the body usually adapts to whatever is causing it. If you seek treatment, your doctor will base it on the cause of your condition and your symptoms. It may include medications and balance exercises. Even if no cause is found or if your dizziness persists, prescription drugs and other treatments may make your symptoms more manageable. Medications - Water pills. If you have Meniere's disease, your doctor may prescribe a water pill (diuretic). This along with a low-salt diet may help reduce how often you have dizziness episodes. - Medications that reduce the dizziness. Antihistamines such as meclizine (Antivert) may offer short-term relief from vertigo. Anticholinergics help reduce dizziness. They include scopolamine skin patches (Transderm Scop). - Anti-nausea medications. Your doctor may prescribe a drug to provide immediate relief of nausea. Some of these can cause drowsiness. - Anti-anxiety medications. Diazepam (Valium) and alprazolam (Xanax) are in a class of drugs called benzodiazepines, which may cause addiction. They may also cause drowsiness. - Preventive medicine for migraine. Certain medicines may help prevent attacks of migraine. Therapy - Head position maneuvers. A technique called canalith repositioning (or Epley maneuver) usually helps resolve benign paroxysmal positional vertigo more quickly than simply waiting for your dizziness to go away. It can be done by your doctor, an audiologist or a physical therapist and involves maneuvering the position of your head. It's usually effective after one or two treatments. Before undergoing this procedure, tell your care provider if you have a neck or back condition, a detached retina or blood vessel problems. - Balance therapy. You may learn specific exercises to help make your balance system less sensitive to motion. This physical therapy technique is called vestibular rehabilitation. It is used for people with dizziness from inner ear conditions such as vestibular neuritis. - Psychotherapy. This type of therapy may help people whose dizziness is caused by anxiety disorders. Surgical or other procedures - Injections. Your doctor may inject your inner ear with the antibiotic gentamicin to disable the balance function. The unaffected ear takes over that function. - Removal of the inner ear sense organ. A procedure that's rarely used is called labyrinthectomy. It disables the vestibular labyrinth in the affected ear. The other ear takes over the balance function. This technique may be used if you have serious hearing loss and your dizziness hasn't responded to other treatments. Dizziness usually goes away on its own. If you tend to experience repeated episodes of dizziness, consider these tips: - Be aware of the possibility of losing your balance, which can lead to falling and serious injury. - Avoid moving suddenly and walk with a cane for stability, if needed. - Fall-proof your home by removing tripping hazards such as area rugs and exposed electrical cords. Use nonslip mats on your bath and shower floors. Use good lighting. - Sit or lie down immediately when you feel dizzy. Lie still with your eyes closed in a darkened room if you're experiencing a severe episode of vertigo. - Avoid driving a car or operating heavy machinery if you experience frequent dizziness without warning. - Avoid using caffeine, alcohol, salt and tobacco. Excessive use of these substances can worsen your signs and symptoms. - Drink enough fluids, eat a healthy diet, get enough sleep and avoid stress. - If your dizziness is caused by a medication, talk with your doctor about discontinuing it or lowering the dose. - If your dizziness comes with nausea, try an over-the-counter (nonprescription) antihistamine, such as meclizine (Antivert) or one containing dimenhydrinate (Dramamine). These may cause drowsiness. Nondrowsy antihistamines aren't as effective. - If your dizziness is caused by overheating or dehydration, rest in a cool place and drink water or a sports drink (Gatorade, Powerade, others).",

        "section": "Myasthenia gravis: Myasthenia gravis is a neuromuscular disorder. Neuromuscular disorders involve the muscles and the nerves that control them. Myasthenia gravis is a type of autoimmune disorder. An autoimmune disorder occurs when the immune system mistakenly attacks healthy tissue. Antibodies are proteins made by the body's immune system when it detects harmful substances. Antibodies may be produced when the immune system mistakenly considers healthy tissue a harmful substance, such as in the case of myasthenia gravis. In people with myasthenia gravis, the body produces antibodies that block the muscle cells from receiving messages (neurotransmitters) from the nerve cells.   The exact cause of myasthenia gravis is unknown. In some cases, it is linked to tumors of the thymus (an organ of the immune system).   Myasthenia gravis can affect people at any age. It is most common in young women and older men. Myasthenia gravis causes weakness of the voluntary muscles -- muscles that are under your control. Autonomic muscles of the heart and digestive tract are usually not affected. The muscle weakness of myasthenia gravis worsens with activity and improves with rest.   This muscle weakness can lead to a variety of symptoms, including:      - Breathing difficulty because of weakness of the chest wall muscles   - Chewing or swallowing difficulty, causing frequent gagging, choking, or drooling   - Difficulty climbing stairs, lifting objects, or rising from a seated position   - Difficulty talking   - Drooping head and eyelids   - Facial paralysis or weakness of the facial muscles   - Fatigue   - Hoarseness or changing voice   - Double vision   - Difficulty maintaining steady gaze The health care provider will perform a physical exam. This includes a detailed nervous system (neurological) examination. This may show:     - Muscle weakness, with eye muscles usually affected first   - Normal reflexes and feeling (sensation)      Tests that may be done include:     - Acetylcholine receptor antibodies associated with this disease   - CT or MRI scan of the chest to look for a tumor   - Nerve conduction studies   - EMG   - Pulmonary function tests   - Edrophonium test to see if this medicine reverses the symptoms for a short time There is no known cure for myasthenia gravis. Treatment may allow you to have periods without any symptoms (remission).   Lifestyle changes can often help you continue your daily activities. The following may be recommended:     - Resting throughout the day   - Using an eye patch if double vision is bothersome   - Avoiding stress and heat exposure, which can make symptoms worse      Medicines that may be prescribed include:     - Neostigmine or pyridostigmine to improve communication between the nerves and muscles   - Prednisone and other drugs (such as azathioprine, cyclosporine, or mycophenolate mofetil) to suppress the immune system response if you have severe symptoms and other medicines have not worked well.      Crisis situations are attacks of weakness of the breathing muscles. These attacks can occur without warning when either too much or too little medicine is taken. These attacks usually last no longer than a few weeks. You may need to be admitted to the hospital, where you may need breathing assistance with a ventilator.   A procedure called plasmapheresis may also be used to help end the crisis. This procedure involves removing the clear part of the blood (plasma), which contains the antibodies. This is replaced with donated plasma that is free of antibodies, or with other fluids. Plasmapheresis may also help reduce symptoms for 4 to 6 weeks and is often used before surgery.   Another procedure, called intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg), may also be done. With this procedure, a large amount of helpful antibodies are given directly into the bloodstream.   Surgery to remove the thymus (thymectomy) may result in permanent remission or less need for medicines, especially when there is a tumor present.   If you have eye problems, your doctor may suggest lens prisms to improve vision. Surgery may also be recommended to treat your eye muscles.   Physical therapy can help maintain your muscle strength. This is especially important for the muscles that support breathing.   Some medicines can worsen symptoms and should be avoided. Before taking any medicine, ask your doctor whether it is\u00a0OK for you to take it. You can ease the stress of illness by joining a\u00a0myasthenia gravis support group. Sharing with others who have common experiences and problems can help you not feel alone. There is no cure, but long-term remission is possible. You may have to restrict some daily activities. People who have only eye symptoms (ocular myasthenia gravis), may develop generalized myasthenia over time.   A woman with myasthenia gravis can get pregnant, but careful prenatal care is important. The baby may be weak and require medications for a few weeks after birth, but usually will not develop the disorder. The condition may cause life-threatening breathing problems. This is called a myasthenic crisis.   Patients with myasthenia gravis are at higher risk for other autoimmune disorders, such as thyrotoxicosis, rheumatoid arthritis, and systemic lupus erythematosus (lupus). Call your health care provider if you develop symptoms of myasthenia gravis.

        "article": " Myasthenia gravis Neuromuscular disorder - myasthenia gravis Summary Myasthenia gravis is a neuromuscular disorder. Neuromuscular disorders involve the muscles and the nerves that control them. Causes Myasthenia gravis is a type of autoimmune disorder. An autoimmune disorder occurs when the immune system mistakenly attacks healthy tissue. Antibodies are proteins made by the body's immune system when it detects harmful substances. Antibodies may be produced when the immune system mistakenly considers healthy tissue to be a harmful substance, such as in the case of myasthenia gravis. In people with myasthenia gravis, the body produces antibodies that block the muscle cells from receiving messages (neurotransmitters) from the nerve cells. In some cases, myasthenia gravis is linked to tumors of the thymus (an organ of the immune system). Myasthenia gravis can affect people at any age. It is most common in young women and older men. Symptoms Myasthenia gravis causes weakness of the voluntary muscles. These are muscles that you can control. Autonomic muscles of the heart and digestive tract are usually not affected. The muscle weakness of myasthenia gravis worsens with activity and improves with rest. This muscle weakness can lead to a variety of symptoms, including: Breathing difficulty because of weakness of the chest wall muscles Chewing or swallowing difficulty, causing frequent gagging, choking, or drooling Difficulty climbing stairs, lifting objects, or rising from a seated position Difficulty talking Drooping head and eyelids Facial paralysis or weakness of the facial muscles Fatigue Hoarseness or changing voice Double vision Difficulty maintaining steady gaze Exams and Tests The health care provider will perform a physical exam. This includes a detailed nervous system (neurological) examination. This may show: Muscle weakness, with eye muscles usually affected first Normal reflexes and feeling (sensation) Tests that may be done include: Acetylcholine receptor antibodies associated with this disease CT or MRI scan of the chest to look for a tumor Nerve conduction studies to test how fast electrical signals move through a nerve EMG to test the health of the muscles and the nerves that control the muscles Pulmonary function tests to measure breathing and how well the lungs are functioning Edrophonium test to see if this medicine reverses the symptoms for a short time Treatment There is no known cure for myasthenia gravis. Treatment may allow you to have periods without any symptoms (remission). Lifestyle changes can often help you continue your daily activities. The following may be recommended: Resting throughout the day Using an eye patch if double vision is bothersome Avoiding stress and heat exposure, which can make symptoms worse Medicines that may be prescribed include: Neostigmine or pyridostigmine to improve communication between the nerves and muscles Prednisone and other drugs (such as azathioprine, cyclosporine, or mycophenolate mofetil) to suppress the immune system response if you have severe symptoms and other medicines have not worked well. Crisis situations are attacks of weakness of the breathing muscles. These attacks can occur without warning when either too much or too little medicine is taken. These attacks usually last no longer than a few weeks. You may need to be admitted to the hospital, where you may need breathing assistance with a ventilator. A procedure called plasmapheresis may also be used to help end the crisis. This procedure involves removing the clear part of the blood (plasma), which contains the antibodies. This is replaced with donated plasma that is free of antibodies, or with other fluids. Plasmapheresis may also help reduce symptoms for 4 to 6 weeks and is often used before surgery. A medicine called intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) may also be used Surgery to remove the thymus (thymectomy) may result in permanent remission or less need for medicines, especially when there is a tumor present. If you have eye problems, your doctor may suggest lens prisms to improve vision. Surgery may also be recommended to treat your eye muscles. Physical therapy can help maintain your muscle strength.

Also tell your doctor if you have or have ever had ulcers, bleeding in your stomach or intestines, or other bleeding disorders. If you experience any of the following symptoms, stop taking ibuprofen and call your doctor: stomach pain, heartburn, vomit that is bloody or looks like coffee grounds, blood in the stool, or black and tarry stools.   Keep all appointments with your doctor and the laboratory. Your doctor will monitor your symptoms carefully and will probably order certain tests to check your body's response to ibuprofen. Be sure to tell your doctor how you are feeling so that your doctor can prescribe the right amount of medication to treat your condition with the lowest risk of serious side effects.   Your doctor or pharmacist will give you the manufacturer's patient information sheet (Medication Guide) when you begin treatment with prescription ibuprofen and each time you refill your prescription. Read the information carefully and ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions. You can also visit the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) website (http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/ucm085729.htm) or the manufacturer's website to obtain the Medication Guide. Prescription ibuprofen is used to relieve pain, tenderness, swelling, and stiffness caused by osteoarthritis (arthritis caused by a breakdown of the lining of the joints) and rheumatoid arthritis (arthritis caused by swelling of the lining of the joints). It is also used to relieve mild to moderate pain, including menstrual pain (pain that happens before or during a menstrual period). Nonprescription ibuprofen is used to reduce fever and to relieve minor aches and pain from headaches, muscle aches, arthritis, menstrual periods, the common cold, toothaches, and backaches. Ibuprofen is in a class of medications called NSAIDs. It works by stopping the body's production of a substance that causes pain, fever, and inflammation. Prescription ibuprofen comes as a tablet to take by mouth. It is usually taken three or four times a day for arthritis or every 4 to 6 hours as needed for pain. Nonprescription ibuprofen comes as a tablet, chewable tablet, suspension (liquid), and drops (concentrated liquid). Adults and children older than 12 years of age may usually take nonprescription ibuprofen every 4 to 6 hours as needed for pain or fever. Children and infants may usually be given nonprescription ibuprofen every 6 to 8 hours as needed for pain or fever, but should not be given more than 4 doses in 24 hours. Ibuprofen may be taken with food or milk to prevent stomach upset. If you are taking ibuprofen on a regular basis, you should take it at the same time(s) every day. Follow the directions on the package or prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take ibuprofen exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than directed by the package label or prescribed by your doctor.   Ibuprofen comes alone and in combination with other medications. Some of these combination products are available by prescription only, and some of these combination products are available without a prescription and are used to treat cough and cold symptoms and other conditions. If your doctor has prescribed a medication that contains ibuprofen, you should be careful not to take any nonprescription medications that also contain ibuprofen.   If you are selecting a product to treat cough or cold symptoms, ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice on which product is best for you. Check nonprescription product labels carefully before using two or more products at the same time. These products may contain the same active ingredient(s) and taking them together could cause you to receive an overdose. This is especially important if you will be giving cough and cold medications to a child.   Nonprescription cough and cold combination products, including products that contain ibuprofen, can cause serious side effects or death in young children. Do not give these products to children younger than 4 years of age. If you give these products to children 4 to 11 years of age, use caution and follow the package directions carefully.   If you are giving ibuprofen or a combination product that contains ibuprofen to a child, read the package label carefully to be sure that it is the right product for a child of that age. Do not give ibuprofen products that are made for adults to children.   Before you give an ibuprofen product to a child, check the package label to find out how much medication the child should receive. Give the dose that matches the child's age on the chart. Ask the child's doctor if you don't know how much medication to give the child.   Shake the suspension and drops well before each use to mix the medication evenly. Use the measuring cup provided to measure each dose of the suspension, and use the dosing device provided to measure each dose of the drops.   The chewable tablets may cause a burning feeling in the mouth or throat. Take the chewable tablets with food or water.   Stop taking nonprescription ibuprofen and call your doctor if your symptoms get worse, you develop new or unexpected symptoms, the part of your body that was painful becomes red or swollen, your pain lasts for more than 10 days, or your fever lasts more than 3 days. Stop giving nonprescription ibuprofen to your child and call your child's doctor if your child does not start to feel better during the first 24 hours of treatment. Also stop giving nonprescription ibuprofen to your child and call your child's doctor if your child develops new symptoms, including redness or swelling on the painful part of his body, or if your child's pain or fever get worse or lasts longer than 3 days.   Do not give nonprescription ibuprofen to a child who has a sore throat that is severe or does not go away, or that comes along with fever, headache, nausea, or vomiting. Call the child's doctor right away, because these symptoms may be signs of a more serious condition.

Tell your doctor if you take any of the following medications: anticoagulants ('blood thinners') such as warfarin (Coumadin, Jantoven); aspirin; other NSAIDs such as ketoprofen and naproxen (Aleve, Naprosyn); oral steroids such as dexamethasone, methylprednisolone (Medrol), and prednisone (Rayos); selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) such as citalopram (Celexa), fluoxetine (Prozac, Sarafem, Selfemra, in Symbyax), fluvoxamine (Luvox), paroxetine (Brisdelle, Paxil, Pexeva), and sertraline (Zoloft); or serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) such as desvenlafaxine (Khedezla, Pristiq), duloxetine (Cymbalta), and venlafaxine (Effexor XR). Also tell your doctor if you have or have ever had ulcers, bleeding in your stomach or intestines, or other bleeding disorders. If you experience any of the following symptoms, stop taking ibuprofen and call your doctor: stomach pain, heartburn, vomit that is bloody or looks like coffee grounds, blood in the stool, or black and tarry stools. Keep all appointments with your doctor and the laboratory. Your doctor will monitor your symptoms carefully and will probably order certain tests to check your body's response to ibuprofen. Be sure to tell your doctor how you are feeling so that your doctor can prescribe the right amount of medication to treat your condition with the lowest risk of serious side effects. Your doctor or pharmacist will give you the manufacturer's patient information sheet (Medication Guide) when you begin treatment with prescription ibuprofen and each time you refill your prescription. Read the information carefully and ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions. You can also visit the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) website (http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/ucm085729.htm) or the manufacturer's website to obtain the Medication Guide. Why is this medication prescribed? Prescription ibuprofen is used to relieve pain, tenderness, swelling, and stiffness caused by osteoarthritis (arthritis caused by a breakdown of the lining of the joints) and rheumatoid arthritis (arthritis caused by swelling of the lining of the joints). It is also used to relieve mild to moderate pain, including menstrual pain (pain that happens before or during a menstrual period). Nonprescription ibuprofen is used to reduce fever and to relieve minor aches and pain from headaches, muscle aches, arthritis, menstrual periods, the common cold, toothaches, and backaches. Ibuprofen is in a class of medications called NSAIDs. It works by stopping the body's production of a substance that causes pain, fever, and inflammation. How should this medicine be used? Prescription ibuprofen comes as a tablet to take by mouth. It is usually taken three or four times a day for arthritis or every 4 to 6 hours as needed for pain. Nonprescription ibuprofen comes as a tablet, chewable tablet, suspension (liquid), and drops (concentrated liquid). Adults and children older than 12 years of age may usually take nonprescription ibuprofen every 4 to 6 hours as needed for pain or fever. Children and infants may usually be given nonprescription ibuprofen every 6 to 8 hours as needed for pain or fever, but should not be given more than 4 doses in 24 hours. Ibuprofen may be taken with food or milk to prevent stomach upset. If you are taking ibuprofen on a regular basis, you should take it at the same time(s) every day. Follow the directions on the package or prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take ibuprofen exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than directed by the package label or prescribed by your doctor. Ibuprofen comes alone and in combination with other medications. Some of these combination products are available by prescription only, and some of these combination products are available without a prescription and are used to treat cough and cold symptoms and other conditions. If your doctor has prescribed a medication that contains ibuprofen, you should be careful not to take any nonprescription medications that also contain ibuprofen. If you are selecting a product to treat cough or cold symptoms, ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice on which product is best for you. Check nonprescription product labels carefully before using two or more products at the same time. These products may contain the same active ingredient(s) and taking them together could cause you to receive an overdose. This is especially important if you will be giving cough and cold medications to a child. Nonprescription cough and cold combination products, including products that contain ibuprofen, can cause serious side effects or death in young children. Do not give these products to children younger than 4 years of age. If you give these products to children 4 to 11 years of age, use caution and follow the package directions carefully. If you are giving ibuprofen or a combination product that contains ibuprofen to a child, read the package label carefully to be sure that it is the right product for a child of that age. Do not give ibuprofen products that are made for adults to children. Before you give an ibuprofen product to a child, check the package label to find out how much medication the child should receive. Give the dose that matches the child's age on the chart. Ask the child's doctor if you don't know how much medication to give the child. Shake the suspension and drops well before each use to mix the medication evenly. Use the measuring cup provided to measure each dose of the suspension, and use the dosing device provided to measure each dose of the drops. The chewable tablets may cause a burning feeling in the mouth or throat. Take the chewable tablets with food or water. Stop taking nonprescription ibuprofen and call your doctor if your symptoms get worse, you develop new or unexpected symptoms, the part of your body that was painful becomes red or swollen, your pain lasts for more than 10 days, or your fever lasts more than 3 days. Stop giving nonprescription ibuprofen to your child and call your child's doctor if your child does not start to feel better during the first 24 hours of treatment. Also stop giving nonprescription ibuprofen to your child and call your child's doctor if your child develops new symptoms, including redness or swelling on the painful part of his body, or if your child's pain or fever get worse or lasts longer than 3 days. Do not give nonprescription ibuprofen to a child who has a sore throat that is severe or does not go away, or that comes along with fever, headache, nausea, or vomiting. Call the child's doctor right away, because these symptoms may be signs of a more serious condition. Other uses for this medicine Ibuprofen is also sometimes used to treat ankylosing spondylitis (arthritis that mainly affects the spine), gouty arthritis (joint pain caused by a build-up of certain substances in the joints), and psoriatic arthritis (arthritis that occurs with a long-lasting skin disease that causes scaling and swelling).

If the victim has collapsed, had a seizure, has trouble breathing, or can't be awakened, immediately call emergency services at 911. <h3>Symptoms of overdosage may include: </h3> /h3> dizziness fast eye movements that you cannot control slow breathing or short periods of time without breathing blue color around the lips, mouth, and nose What other information should I know? If you are taking prescription ibuprofen, do not let anyone else take your medication. Ask your pharmacist any questions you have about refilling your prescription. It is important for you to keep a written list of all of the prescription and nonprescription (over-the-counter) medicines you are taking, as well as any products such as vitamins, minerals, or other dietary supplements. You should bring this list with you each time you visit a doctor or if you are admitted to a hospital. It is also important information to carry with you in case of emergencies.

    "multi_abs_summ": "Adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD) belongs to genetic disorders called leukodystrophies. These disease cause damage to  myelin that covers nerve cells. The damage is caused by a buildup of very long chain fatty acids (VLCFA) in the brain and adrenal cortex.  Both men and women may get the disease. Since the disease is linked to X chromosome and men have only one of those, they are affected more severely. Almost all people with ALD have adrenal insufficiency (Addison's disease.)  The neurological symptoms can begin either in childhood or in adulthood. The childhood cerebral form starts between ages 4 and 10, usually, with behavioral changes such as abnormal withdrawal or aggression, poor memory, and poor school performance. Children may also experience visual loss, learning disabilities, seizures, poorly articulated speech, difficulty swallowing, deafness, disturbances of gait and coordination, fatigue, intermittent vomiting, increased skin pigmentation, progressive dementia, long term coma and death within 10 years. There are no specific treatments for adrenoleukodystrophy.  Special diets could protect the body from VLCFA buildup. Adrenocortical insufficiency caused by the damage to the adrenal glands is treated with steroids. Bone marrow transplantation (BMT) might help.",

People with X-ALD accumulate high levels of saturated, very long chain fatty acids (VLCFA) in the brain and adrenal cortex.

The childhood form of X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy is a progressive disease. It leads to a long-term coma (vegetative state) about 2 years after nervous system symptoms develop.

X-ALD should not be confused with neonatal adrenoleukodsystrophy, which is a disease of newborns and young infants and belongs to the group of peroxisomal biogenesis disorders. Is there any treatment? Adrenal function must be tested periodically in all patients with ALD. Treatment with adrenal hormones can be lifesaving. Symptomatic and supportive treatments for ALD include physical therapy, psychological support, and special education. Recent evidence suggests that a mixture of oleic acid and erucic acid, known as \"Lorenzo's Oil,\" administered to boys with X-ALD prior to symptom onset can prevent or delay the appearance of the childhood cerebral form It is not known whether Lorenzo's Oil will have any beneficial effects in AMN. Furthermore, Lorenzo's Oil has no beneficial effect in symptomatic boys with X-ALD. Bone marrow transplantations can provide long-term benefit to boys who have early evidence of the childhood cerebral form of X-ALD, but the procedure carries risk of mortality and morbidity and is not recommended for those whose symptoms are already severe or who have the adult-onset or neonatal forms. What is the prognosis? Prognosis for patients with childhood cerebral X-ALD is generally poor due to progressive neurological deterioration unless bone marrow transplantation is performed early. Death usually occurs within 1 to 10 years after the onset of symptoms. Adult-onset AMN will progress over decades. What research is being done? The NINDS supports research on genetic disorders such as ALD. The aim of this research is to find ways to prevent, treat, and cure these disorders. Studies are currently underway to identify new biomarkers of disease progression and to determine which patients will develop the childhood cerebral form of X-ALD. A recent case study in Europe demonstrated that the combination of gene therapy with bone marrow transplantation, using the patient's own bone marrow cells, may arrest disease progression in childhood cerebral X-ALD. A therapeutic trail in the United States is currently being discussed with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. ",

        "article": " X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy X-ALD Adrenoleukodystrophy ALD Summary X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (X-ALD) is a genetic disease that affects the nervous system and the adrenal glands (small glands located on top of each kidney). People with this disease often have progressive loss of the fatty covering ( myelin ) that surrounds the nerves in the brain and spinal cord. They may also have a shortage of certain hormones that is caused by damage to the outer layer of the adrenal glands (adrenal cortex). This is called adrenocortical insufficiency, or Addison disease. [1] There are three forms of X-ALD: a childhood cerebral form, an adrenomyeloneuropathy (AMN) type, and an adrenal-insufficiency-only-type. The disease primarily affects males. [1] X-ALD is caused by a variation ( mutation ) in the ABCD1 gene and it is inherited in an X-linked. manner. Diagnosis of the disease is based on testing the levels of a molecule called very long-chain fatty acids (VLCFA). The diagnosis can be confirmed with genetic testing . There is still no cure for X-ALD, but taking special oils such as Lorenzo's oil can lower the blood levels of VLCFA. Bone marrow transplantation may be an option for boys who have evidence of brain involvement on MRI but do not yet have obvious symptoms of the disease with a normal neurological exam. Adrenocortical insufficiency is treated with corticosteroids . [2] Symptoms X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (X-ALD) symptoms are very varied. Basically there are three main types that are present in about 90% or 95% of the affected people: a childhood cerebral form or symptoms set 1, an adrenomyeloneuropathy (AMN) type or symptoms set 2, and an adrenal insufficiency-only type, or symptoms set 3. There are other other less common presentations (types) of the disease, known as symptoms sets 4 to 8: Childhood cerebral form of X-ALD (or symptoms set 1): It mostly present with neurological problems, and typically begin between ages 4-8 years-old. The first noticeable symptom is usually behavior problems in school such as struggling to pay attention. Some boys may have seizures as their first symptom. As the disease progresses, other symptoms may include vomiting, vision loss, learning disabilities, trouble eating ( dysphagia ), deafness, fatigue, and trouble coordinating movements ( ataxia ).[2][3] Adrenomyeloneuropathy (AMN) type (or symptoms set 2): Presents with both adrenal and neurological problems. It usually begin in early to mid-adulthood, and it is the most common presentation. Symptoms can include leg stiffness, weakness and pain in the hands and feet ( peripheral neuropathy ), muscle spasms and weakness, and urinary problems or sexual dysfunction.[2] Adrenal insufficiency-only (Addison disease-only) type (or symptoms set 3): It is characterized by adrenal insufficiency without neurologic problems. Symptoms of adrenal insufficiency can develop at any time between childhood and adulthood and include decreased appetite, increased pigment (melanin) in the skin making it appear darker, muscle weakness, and vomiting.[4] Symptoms seen in about 5%-10% of affected males may include: [2] Symptom set 4: Onset is between age four and ten years but may occur in adolescence or, rarely, in adults, and may include headache, increased intracranial pressure, paralysis of one side of the body (hemiparesis) or visual field defect, difficulty speaking or other signs of localized brain disease. Symptom set 5: Progressive behavioral disturbance, dementia , and paralysis in an adult Symptom set 6: Progressive lack of coordination in a child or adult Symptom set 7: Problems with urination and bowel abnormalities and occasionally impotence in at-risk males who have other affected relatives Symptom set 8. No evidence of neurologic or endocrine dysfunction Approximately 20% of female who are carriers develop mild to moderate weakness and spasticity (stiffness) of the legs (spastic paraparesis) in middle age or later. Adrenal function is usually normal. [2] This table lists symptoms that people with this disease may have. For most diseases, symptoms will vary from person to person. People with the same disease may not have all the symptoms listed. This information comes from a database called the Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) .

This gene provides instructions to make a protein called the adrenoleukodystrophy protein (ALDP). ALDP normally moves a type of fat molecule called very long-chain fatty acids (VLCFA) into a special part of the cell to be broken down. When the ABCD1 gene is changed, there is too little ALDP in the cells or the ALDP that is made does not work normally. This causes VLCFA to build up in the body. High levels of VLCFA are thought to be damaging to the outside of the adrenal glands (adrenal cortex) and the fatty covering ( myelin ) that surrounds the nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord. Researchers believe the damage caused by VLCFA may involve inflammation, especially in the brain. [1] [2] Inheritance X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (X-ALD) is inherited in an X-linked manner. [1] This means that the ABCD1 gene is located on the X chromosome . The X chromosome is one of the sex chromosomes . Each woman has two X chromosomes, and each man has one X chromosome and one Y chromosome . Because men have only one X chromosome, they only have one copy of the ABCD1 gene. If this gene has a disease-causing change, they will have X-ALD. Women who have disease-causing changes in one copy of the ABCD1 gene are known as carriers of the disease. About 80% of carriers do not have signs or symptoms of X-ALD because they have another working copy of ABCD1. However, about 20% of female carriers have symptoms that are similar to the adrenomyeloneuropathy (AMN) type of X-ALD. [2] If a male is diagnosed with X-ALD, it is likely that his mother is a carrier of the disease. However, about 5% of cases of X-ALD are caused by a new genetic change ( de novo ) in the individual. In these situations, the mother is not a carrier of the disease, and other family members are not at risk to have children with X-ALD. Therefore, when a male is diagnosed with X-ALD, it is important to determine if his mother is a carrier by testing her VLCFA levels or by genetic testing . [2] If a woman is found to be a carrier of X-ALD, for each of her children there is a 50% chance that he or she will inherit the change in ABCD1. This means that for each son, there is a 50% chance that he will be affected with X-ALD. For each daughter, there is a 50% chance that she will be a carrier of the disease like her mother. X-ALD shows a characteristic known as variable expressivity. This means that the exact symptoms of each person with X-ALD can differ, even within the same family. For example, some boys may have the childhood cerebral form of X-ALD, while other members of the same family may have the adrenal insufficiency-only type. [2] It is not known what causes variable expressivity of the disease to occur. The symptoms cannot be predicted by levels of VLCFA or by looking at the exact genetic change ( mutation ) in each individual. [2] Diagnosis X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (X-ALD) is suspected when a doctor observes signs and symptoms of the disease. X-ALD should be considered as a possible cause of symptoms in four situations: [2] Boys with attention deficit disorder (ADD) who also have signs of neurological problems Young men with progressive trouble walking or coordinating movements All males with adrenal insufficiency (Addison disease), even in the absence of other symptoms Adult women with progressive muscle weakness or wasting If a diagnosis of X-ALD is suspected, a blood test of very long-chain fatty acids will detect elevated levels in 99% of males. Genetic testing can be used to confirm the diagnosis. After diagnosis, a brain MRI can be completed to determine the extent of the disease. A brain MRI will be abnormal even if symptoms of the disease are not very severe. [2] Testing Resources The Genetic Testing Registry (GTR) provides information about the genetic tests for this condition. The intended audience for the GTR is health care providers and researchers. Patients and consumers with specific questions about a genetic test should contact a health care provider or a genetics professional. Treatment The treatment for X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (X-ALD) depends on the signs and symptoms present in each person and may include: [2] [5] Corticosteroids adrenal insufficiency Physical therapy adrenomyeloneuropathy (AMN) Bone marrow transplant brain MRI Lorenzo's oil Clinical trials investigating treatment with gene therapy are currently underway and have shown some preliminary success. [2] [6] Prognosis The long-term outlook for people affected by X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (X-ALD) depends on the exact type of the disease that each person has. The childhood cerebral form of the disease is progressive. Boys with this form of the disease often pass away within a few years of beginning to show symptoms. [2] The other forms of X-ALD are less severe. The disease for these individuals may be slowly progressive, or it may not affect a person's lifespan at all. [2] It is important to remember that the exact signs and symptoms of a person with X-ALD cannot be predicted by the signs and symptoms of other members of the family. Therefore, the long-term outlook for individuals who have X-ALD within the same family can be very different. [2] Find a Specialist If you need medical advice, you can look for doctors or other healthcare professionals who have experience with this disease. You may find these specialists through advocacy organizations, clinical trials, or articles published in medical journals. You may also want to contact a university or tertiary medical center in your area, because these centers tend to see more complex cases and have the latest technology and treatments. If you can't find a specialist in your local area, try contacting national or international specialists. They may be able to refer you to someone they know through conferences or research efforts. Some specialists may be willing to consult with you or your local doctors over the phone or by email if you can't travel to them for care. You can find more tips in our guide, How to Find a Disease Specialist. We also encourage you to explore the rest of this page to find resources that can help you find specialists. Healthcare Resources To find a medical professional who specializes in genetics, you can ask your doctor for a referral or you can search for one yourself.

    "question": "know more about My Daughter have Distal renal tubular acidosis. we are from Mexico, and we ae woundering if can send to us more infomation. maybe you can reccommend to us a association???? i don?t know",
    "multi_abs_summ": "SLC4A1-associated distal renal tubular acidosis is a kidney (renal) disorder that sometimes includes blood cell abnormalities. The kidneys normally filter fluid and waste products from the body and remove them in urine. in people with distal renal tubular acidosis, the kidneys are unable to remove enough acid from the body, and the blood becomes too acidic. This chemical imbalance is called metabolic acidosis. The inability to remove acids from the body often results in slowed growth and may also lead to softening and weakening of the bones, called rickets in children and osteomalacia in adults. This bone disorder is characterized by bone pain, bowed legs, and difficulty walking. In addition, most children and adults with SLC4A1-associated distal renal tubular acidosis have excess calcium in the urine (hypercalciuria), calcium deposits in the kidneys (nephrocalcinosis), and kidney stones (nephrolithiasis). In rare cases, these kidney abnormalities lead to life-threatening kidney failure. Affected individuals may also have low levels of potassium in the blood (hypokalemia). Individuals with the features described above have complete distal renal tubular acidosis, which usually becomes apparent in childhood. Some people do not develop metabolic acidosis even though their kidneys have trouble removing acids; these individuals are said to have incomplete distal renal tubular acidosis. Additionally, these individuals may have other features of distal renal tubular acidosis, such as bone problems and kidney stones. Often, people who initially have incomplete distal renal tubular acidosis develop metabolic acidosis later in life. Some people with SLC4A1-associated distal renal tubular acidosis also have blood cell abnormalities. These can vary in severity from no symptoms to a condition called hemolytic anemia, in which red blood cells prematurely break down (undergo hemolysis), causing a shortage of red blood cells (anemia). Hemolytic anemia can lead to unusually pale skin (pallor), extreme tiredness (fatigue), shortness of breath (dyspnea), and an enlarged spleen (splenomegaly). There are two forms of SLC4A1-associated distal renal tubular acidosis; they are distinguished by their inheritance pattern.

    "multi_ext_summ": "SLC4A1-associated distal renal tubular acidosis is a kidney (renal) disorder that sometimes includes blood cell abnormalities. The kidneys normally filter fluid and waste products from the body and remove them in urine; however, in people with distal renal tubular acidosis, the kidneys are unable to remove enough acid from the body, and the blood becomes too acidic. This chemical imbalance is called metabolic acidosis. The inability to remove acids from the body often results in slowed growth and may also lead to softening and weakening of the bones, called rickets in children and osteomalacia in adults. This bone disorder is characterized by bone pain, bowed legs, and difficulty walking. In addition, most children and adults with SLC4A1-associated distal renal tubular acidosis have excess calcium in the urine (hypercalciuria), calcium deposits in the kidneys (nephrocalcinosis), and kidney stones (nephrolithiasis). In rare cases, these kidney abnormalities lead to life-threatening kidney failure. Affected individuals may also have low levels of potassium in the blood (hypokalemia). Individuals with the features described above have complete distal renal tubular acidosis, which usually becomes apparent in childhood. Some people do not develop metabolic acidosis even though their kidneys have trouble removing acids; these individuals are said to have incomplete distal renal tubular acidosis. Additionally, these individuals may have other features of distal renal tubular acidosis, such as bone problems and kidney stones. Often, people who initially have incomplete distal renal tubular acidosis develop metabolic acidosis later in life. Some people with SLC4A1-associated distal renal tubular acidosis also have blood cell abnormalities. These can vary in severity from no symptoms to a condition called hemolytic anemia, in which red blood cells prematurely break down (undergo hemolysis), causing a shortage of red blood cells (anemia).

The autosomal recessive form is always associated with complete distal renal tubular acidosis and is more commonly associated with blood cell abnormalities, although not everyone with this form has abnormal blood cells. Frequency The prevalence of SLC4A1-associated distal renal tubular acidosis is unknown. The condition is most common in Southeast Asia, especially Thailand. Causes Both the autosomal dominant and autosomal recessive forms of SLC4A1-associated distal renal tubular acidosis are caused by mutations in the SLC4A1 gene. This gene provides instructions for making the anion exchanger 1 (AE1) protein, which transports negatively charged atoms (anions) across cell membranes. Specifically, AE1 exchanges negatively charged atoms of chlorine (chloride ions) for negatively charged bicarbonate molecules (bicarbonate ions). The AE1 protein is found in the cell membrane of kidney cells and red blood cells. In kidney cells, the exchange of bicarbonate through AE1 allows acid to be released from the cell into the urine. In red blood cells, AE1 attaches to other proteins that make up the structural framework (the cytoskeleton) of the cells, helping to maintain their structure. The SLC4A1 gene mutations involved in either form of SLC4A1-associated distal renal tubular acidosis lead to production of altered AE1 proteins that cannot get to the correct location in the cell membrane. In the autosomal dominant form of the condition, gene mutations affect only one copy of the SLC4A1 gene, and normal AE1 protein is produced from the other copy. However, the altered protein attaches to the normal protein and keeps it from getting to the correct location, leading to a severe reduction or absence of AE1 protein in the cell membrane. In autosomal recessive distal renal tubular acidosis, both copies of the SLC4A1 gene are mutated, so all of the protein produced from this gene is altered and not able to get to the correct location. Improper location or absence of AE1 in kidney cell membranes disrupts bicarbonate exchange, and as a result, acid cannot be released into the urine. Instead, the acid builds up in the blood in most affected individuals, leading to metabolic acidosis and the other features of complete distal renal tubular acidosis. It is not clear why some people develop metabolic acidosis and others do not. Researchers suggest that in individuals with incomplete distal renal tubular acidosis, another mechanism is able to help regulate blood acidity (pH) and keep metabolic acidosis from developing. In red blood cells, interaction with a protein called glycophorin A can often help the altered AE1 protein get to the cell membrane where it can perform its function, which explains why most people with SLC4A1-associated distal renal tubular acidosis do not have blood cell abnormalities. However, some altered AE1 proteins cannot be helped by glycophorin A and are not found in the cell membrane. Without AE1, the red blood cells are unstable; breakdown of these abnormal red blood cells may lead to hemolytic anemia. Some people have nonhereditary forms of distal renal tubular acidosis; these forms can be caused by immune system problems or other conditions that damage the kidneys. These individuals often have additional signs and symptoms related to the original condition. Inheritance Pattern SLC4A1-associated distal renal tubular acidosis can have different patterns of inheritance. It is usually inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one copy of the altered SLC4A1 gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. In most cases, an affected person inherits the mutation from one affected parent. Other cases result from new mutations in the gene and occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family. Less commonly, SLC4A1-associated distal renal tubular acidosis has an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance, which means a mutation must occur in both copies of the SLC4A1 gene for the condition to develop. This pattern occurs with certain types of SLC4A1 gene mutations. The parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition.

It is usually inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one copy of the altered SLC4A1 gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. In most cases, an affected person inherits the mutation from one affected parent. Other cases result from new mutations in the gene and occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family. Less commonly, SLC4A1-associated distal renal tubular acidosis has an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance, which means a mutation must occur in both copies of the SLC4A1 gene for the condition to develop. This pattern occurs with certain types of SLC4A1 gene mutations. The parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition.

        "section": "Frozen shoulder: Frozen shoulder, also known as adhesive capsulitis, is a condition characterized by stiffness and pain in your shoulder joint. Signs and symptoms typically begin gradually, worsen over time and then resolve, usually within one to three years. Your risk of developing frozen shoulder increases if you're recovering from a medical condition or procedure that prevents you from moving your arm - such as a stroke or a mastectomy. Treatment for frozen shoulder involves range-of-motion exercises and, sometimes, corticosteroids and numbing medications injected into the joint capsule. In a small percentage of cases, arthroscopic surgery may be indicated to loosen the joint capsule so that it can move more freely. It's unusual for frozen shoulder to recur in the same shoulder, but some people can develop it in the opposite shoulder. Frozen shoulder typically develops slowly, and in three stages. Each stage can last a number of months. - Freezing stage. Any movement of your shoulder causes pain, and your shoulder's range of motion starts to become limited.   - Frozen stage. Pain may begin to diminish during this stage. However, your shoulder becomes stiffer, and using it becomes more difficult.   - Thawing stage. The range of motion in your shoulder begins to improve. For some people, the pain worsens at night, sometimes disrupting sleep. The bones, ligaments and tendons that make up your shoulder joint are encased in a capsule of connective tissue. Frozen shoulder occurs when this capsule thickens and tightens around the shoulder joint, restricting its movement. Doctors aren't sure why this happens to some people, although it's more likely to occur in people who have diabetes or those who recently had to immobilize their shoulder for a long period, such as after surgery or an arm fracture. Certain factors may increase your risk of developing frozen shoulder. Age and sex People 40 and older, particularly women, are more likely to have frozen shoulder. Immobility or reduced mobility People who've had prolonged immobility or reduced mobility of the shoulder are at higher risk of developing frozen shoulder.

Diseases that might increase risk include: - Diabetes   - Overactive thyroid (hyperthyroidism)   - Underactive thyroid (hypothyroidism)   - Cardiovascular disease   - Tuberculosis   - Parkinson's disease During the physical exam, your doctor may ask you to move in certain ways to check for pain and evaluate your range of motion (active range of motion). Your doctor might then ask you to relax your muscles while he or she moves your arm (passive range of motion). Frozen shoulder affects both active and passive range of motion. In some cases, your doctor might inject your shoulder with a numbing medicine (anesthetic) to determine your passive and active range of motion. Frozen shoulder can usually be diagnosed from signs and symptoms alone. But your doctor may suggest imaging tests - such as X-rays or an MRI - to rule out other problems. Most frozen shoulder treatment involves controlling shoulder pain and preserving as much range of motion in the shoulder as possible. Medications Over-the-counter pain relievers, such as aspirin and ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, others), can help reduce pain and inflammation associated with frozen shoulder. In some cases, your doctor may prescribe stronger pain-relieving and anti-inflammatory drugs. Therapy A physical therapist can teach you range-of-motion exercises to help recover as much mobility in your shoulder as possible. Your commitment to doing these exercises is important to optimize recovery of your mobility. Surgical and other procedures Most frozen shoulders get better on their own within 12 to 18 months. For persistent symptoms, your doctor may suggest: - Steroid injections. Injecting corticosteroids into your shoulder joint may help decrease pain and improve shoulder mobility, especially in the early stages of the process. - Joint distension. Injecting sterile water into the joint capsule can help stretch the tissue and make it easier to move the joint. - Shoulder manipulation. In this procedure, you receive a general anesthetic, so you'll be unconscious and feel no pain. Then the doctor moves your shoulder joint in different directions, to help loosen the tightened tissue. - Surgery. Surgery for frozen shoulder is rare, but if nothing else has helped, your doctor may recommend surgery to remove scar tissue and adhesions from inside your shoulder joint. Doctors usually perform this surgery with lighted, tubular instruments inserted through small incisions around your joint (arthroscopically). Continue to use the involved shoulder and extremity as much as possible given your pain and range-of-motion limits. Applying heat or cold to your shoulder can help relieve pain. Acupuncture Acupuncture involves inserting extremely fine needles in your skin at specific points on your body. Typically, the needles remain in place for 15 to 40 minutes. During that time they may be moved or manipulated. Because the needles are hair thin and flexible and are generally inserted superficially, most acupuncture treatments are relatively painless. Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) A TENS unit delivers a tiny electrical current to key points on a nerve pathway. The current, delivered through electrodes taped to your skin, isn't painful or harmful. It's not known exactly how TENS works, but it's thought that it might stimulate the release of pain-inhibiting molecules (endorphins) or block pain fibers that carry pain impulses.",

It becomes hard to reach over your head or behind you.   - Finally, the pain goes away and you can use your arm again. This is the thawing phase and can take months to end.      It can take a few months to go through these stages of frozen shoulder. The shoulder can get very painful and stiff before it starts to loosen. It can take as long as 18 to 24 months for complete healing. To help speed healing, your health care provider will likely do the following:      - Teach you exercises to restore motion in your shoulder joint.   - Refer you to a physical therapist.   - Prescribe medicines for you to take by mouth. These include drugs to reduce pain and inflammation in the shoulder joint. You may also receive a shot of anti-inflammatory drug directly into the joint.      Most people have a full recovery with full range of motion without surgery. Using moist heat on your shoulder 3 to 4 times a day may help relieve some pain and stiffness.   For pain, you can use ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), naproxen (Aleve, Naprosyn), or acetaminophen (Tylenol). You can buy these pain medicines at the store.     - Talk with your provider before using these medicines if you have heart disease, high blood pressure, kidney disease, or have had stomach ulcers or internal bleeding in the past.   - DO NOT take more than the amount recommended on the bottle or by your provider. Get help setting up your home so that you can get to everything you need without reaching above your shoulders or behind your back.      - Keep the clothes that you wear most often in drawers and shelves that are between your waist and shoulder level.   - Store food in cupboards, drawers, and refrigerator shelves that are between your waist and shoulder level.      Get help with house cleaning, taking out the garbage, gardening, and other household tasks.   DO NOT lift heavy things or do activities that require a lot of shoulder and arm strength. You will learn some simple exercises and stretches for your shoulder.     - At first, try to do these exercises once every hour, or at least 4 times a day.   - It is more important to do the exercises often than to do them for a long time each time you do them.   - Use moist heat before the exercises to help lessen pain and increase movement.   - The exercises should focus on stretching of the shoulder and range of motion.   - Avoid exercises to strengthen your shoulder until the range of motion has returned.      Some of the exercises are:      - Shoulder stretches   - Pendulum   - Wall crawl   - Rope and pulley stretches   - Movements to help with internal and external rotation, such as hand behind back      Your provider or physical therapist will show you how to do these exercises.

Often the pain and stiffness are present all the time. More About Your Injury The capsule of the shoulder joint is made of strong tissue (ligaments) that hold the shoulder bones to each other. When the capsule becomes inflamed, the shoulder bones cannot move freely in the joint. This condition is called frozen shoulder. Frozen shoulder may develop with no known cause. It can also occur in people who: Have thyroid disease, diabetes, or are going through menopause Have a shoulder injury Have had a stroke that makes them unable to use their arm Have a cast on their arm that holds their arm in one position What to Expect Symptoms of frozen shoulder often follow this pattern: At first, you have a lot of pain, which can come on abruptly even without an injury or trauma. Your shoulder can become very stiff and hard to move, even when the pain lessens. It becomes hard to reach over your head or behind you. This is the freezing phase. Finally, the pain goes away and you can use your arm again. This is the thawing phase and can take months to end. It can take a few months to go through each stage of frozen shoulder. The shoulder can get very painful and stiff before it starts to loosen. It can take as long as 18 to 24 months for complete healing. To help speed healing, your health care provider will likely do the following: Teach you exercises to restore motion in your shoulder joint. Refer you to a physical therapist. Prescribe medicines for you to take by mouth. These include drugs to reduce pain and inflammation in the shoulder joint. You may also receive a shot of anti-inflammatory drug or steroid directly into the joint. Most people have a full recovery with full range of motion without surgery. Symptom Relief Using moist heat on your shoulder 3 to 4 times a day may help relieve some pain and stiffness. For pain, you can use ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), naproxen (Aleve, Naprosyn), or acetaminophen (Tylenol). You can buy these pain medicines at the store.

        "article": " Frozen shoulder Overview Frozen shoulder, also known as adhesive capsulitis, is a condition characterized by stiffness and pain in your shoulder joint. Signs and symptoms typically begin gradually, worsen over time and then resolve, usually within one to three years. Your risk of developing frozen shoulder increases if you're recovering from a medical condition or procedure that prevents you from moving your arm - such as a stroke or a mastectomy. Treatment for frozen shoulder involves range-of-motion exercises and, sometimes, corticosteroids and numbing medications injected into the joint capsule. In a small percentage of cases, arthroscopic surgery may be indicated to loosen the joint capsule so that it can move more freely. It's unusual for frozen shoulder to recur in the same shoulder, but some people can develop it in the opposite shoulder. Symptoms Frozen shoulder typically develops slowly, and in three stages. Each stage can last a number of months. - Freezing stage. Any movement of your shoulder causes pain, and your shoulder's range of motion starts to become limited. - Frozen stage. Pain may begin to diminish during this stage. However, your shoulder becomes stiffer, and using it becomes more difficult. - Thawing stage. The range of motion in your shoulder begins to improve. For some people, the pain worsens at night, sometimes disrupting sleep. Causes The bones, ligaments and tendons that make up your shoulder joint are encased in a capsule of connective tissue. Frozen shoulder occurs when this capsule thickens and tightens around the shoulder joint, restricting its movement. Doctors aren't sure why this happens to some people, although it's more likely to occur in people who have diabetes or those who recently had to immobilize their shoulder for a long period, such as after surgery or an arm fracture. Risk factors Certain factors may increase your risk of developing frozen shoulder. Age and sex People 40 and older, particularly women, are more likely to have frozen shoulder. Immobility or reduced mobility People who've had prolonged immobility or reduced mobility of the shoulder are at higher risk of developing frozen shoulder. Immobility may be the result of many factors, including: - Rotator cuff injury - Broken arm - Stroke - Recovery from surgery Systemic diseases People who have certain diseases appear more likely to develop frozen shoulder. Diseases that might increase risk include: - Diabetes - Overactive thyroid (hyperthyroidism) - Underactive thyroid (hypothyroidism) - Cardiovascular disease - Tuberculosis - Parkinson's disease Diagnosis During the physical exam, your doctor may ask you to move in certain ways to check for pain and evaluate your range of motion (active range of motion). Your doctor might then ask you to relax your muscles while he or she moves your arm (passive range of motion). Frozen shoulder affects both active and passive range of motion. In some cases, your doctor might inject your shoulder with a numbing medicine (anesthetic) to determine your passive and active range of motion. Frozen shoulder can usually be diagnosed from signs and symptoms alone. But your doctor may suggest imaging tests - such as X-rays or an MRI - to rule out other problems. Treatment Most frozen shoulder treatment involves controlling shoulder pain and preserving as much range of motion in the shoulder as possible. Medications Over-the-counter pain relievers, such as aspirin and ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, others), can help reduce pain and inflammation associated with frozen shoulder.

Lifestyle and home remedies Continue to use the involved shoulder and extremity as much as possible given your pain and range-of-motion limits. Applying heat or cold to your shoulder can help relieve pain. Alternative medicine Acupuncture Acupuncture involves inserting extremely fine needles in your skin at specific points on your body. Typically, the needles remain in place for 15 to 40 minutes. During that time they may be moved or manipulated. Because the needles are hair thin and flexible and are generally inserted superficially, most acupuncture treatments are relatively painless. Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) A TENS unit delivers a tiny electrical current to key points on a nerve pathway. The current, delivered through electrodes taped to your skin, isn't painful or harmful. It's not known exactly how TENS works, but it's thought that it might stimulate the release of pain-inhibiting molecules (endorphins) or block pain fibers that carry pain impulses. ",

    "multi_abs_summ": "Some types of dementia cannot be prevented, such as Alzheimer's, though their progression can be slowed. Others can be halted or reversed with appropriate treatment. There are drug-based and treatment-based treatments for dementia. There are drugs that specifically treat Alzheimers disease and other progressive dementias. Medications such as donepezil (Aricept), rivastigmine (Exelon) and galantamine (Razadyne) work by boosting levels of a chemical messenger involved in memory and judgement. These drugs do not halt or reverse the disease, but they can slow its progression. The therapeutic-based approaches include practicing tasks designed to improve memory, attention, and other cognitive abilities. These tasks are not designed to prevent dementia but slow its progression.  An occupational therapist can teach you behaviors to make living with dementia easier.

        "article": " Dementia Chronic brain syndrome Lewy body dementia DLB Vascular dementia Mild cognitive impairment MCI Summary Dementia is a loss of brain function that occurs with certain diseases. It affects memory, thinking, language, judgment, and behavior. Causes Dementia usually occurs in older age. Most types are rare in people under age 60. The risk of dementia increases as a person gets older. Most types of dementia are nonreversible (degenerative). Nonreversible means the changes in the brain that are causing the dementia cannot be stopped or turned back. Alzheimer disease is the most common type of dementia. Another common type of dementia is vascular dementia. It is caused by poor blood flow to the brain, such as with stroke. Lewy body disease is a common cause of dementia in older adults. People with this condition have abnormal protein structures in certain areas of the brain. The following medical conditions can also lead to dementia: Huntington disease Brain injury Multiple sclerosis Infections such as HIV/AIDS, syphilis, and Lyme disease Parkinson disease Pick disease Progressive supranuclear palsy Some causes of dementia may be stopped or reversed if they are found soon enough, including: Brain injury Brain tumors Long-term (chronic) alcohol abuse Changes in blood sugar, sodium, and calcium levels (dementia due to metabolic causes) Low vitamin B12 level Normal pressure hydrocephalus Use of certain medicines, including cimetidine and some cholesterol drugs Some brain infections Symptoms Dementia symptoms include difficulty with many areas of mental function, including: Emotional behavior or personality Language Memory Perception Thinking and judgment (cognitive skills) Dementia usually first appears as forgetfulness. Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is the stage between normal forgetfulness due to aging and the development of dementia. People with MCI have mild problems with thinking and memory that do not interfere with daily activities. They often know about their forgetfulness. Not everyone with MCI develops dementia. Symptoms of MCI include: Difficulty doing more than one task at a time Difficulty solving problems or making decisions Forgetting recent events or conversations Taking longer to do more difficult mental activities Early symptoms of dementia can include: Difficulty with tasks that take some thought, but that used to come easily, such as balancing a checkbook, playing games (such as bridge), and learning new information or routines Getting lost on familiar routes Language problems, such as trouble with the names of familiar objects Losing interest in things previously enjoyed, flat mood Misplacing items Personality changes and loss of social skills, which can lead to inappropriate behaviors As dementia becomes worse, symptoms are more obvious and interfere with the ability to take care of oneself. Symptoms may include: Change in sleep patterns, often waking up at night Difficulty with basic tasks, such as preparing meals, choosing proper clothing, or driving Forgetting details about current events Forgetting events in one's own life history, losing self-awareness Having hallucinations, arguments, striking out, and violent behavior Having delusions, depression, and agitation More difficulty reading or writing Poor judgment and loss of ability to recognize danger Using the wrong word, not pronouncing words correctly, speaking in confusing sentences Withdrawing from social contact People with severe dementia can no longer: Perform basic activities of daily living, such as eating, dressing, and bathing Recognize family members Understand language Other symptoms that may occur with dementia: Problems controlling bowel movements or urine Swallowing problems Exams and Tests A skilled health care provider can often diagnose dementia using the following: Complete physical exam, including nervous system exam Asking about the person's medical history and symptoms Mental function tests (mental status examination) Other tests may be ordered to find out if other problems may be causing dementia or making it worse. These conditions include: Anemia Brain tumor Long-term (chronic) infection Intoxication from medicines Severe depression Thyroid disease Vitamin deficiency The following tests and procedures may be done: B12 level Blood ammonia levels Blood chemistry (chem-20) Blood gas analysis Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis Drug or alcohol levels (toxicology screen) Electroencephalograph (EEG) Head CT Mental status test MRI of head Thyroid function tests, including thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) Thyroid stimulating hormone level Urinalysis Treatment Treatment depends on the condition causing the dementia. Some people may need to stay in the hospital for a short time. Sometimes, dementia medicine can make a person's confusion worse. Stopping or changing these medicines is part of the treatment. Certain mental exercises can help with dementia. Treating conditions that can lead to confusion often greatly improve mental function. Such conditions include: Anemia Congestive heart failure Decreased blood oxygen (hypoxia) Depression Heart failure Infections Nutritional disorders Thyroid disorders Medicines may be used to: Slow the rate at which symptoms get worse, though improvement with these drugs may be small Control problems with behavior, such as loss of judgment or confusion Someone with dementia will need support in the home as the disease gets worse. Family members or other caregivers can assist by helping the person cope with memory loss and behavior and sleep problems. It is important to make sure the homes of people who have dementia are safe for them. Outlook (Prognosis) People with MCI do not always develop dementia. When dementia does occur, it usually gets worse over time. Dementia often decreases quality of life and lifespan. Families will likely need to plan for their loved one's future care. When to Contact a Medical Professional Call your provider if: Dementia develops or a sudden change in mental status occurs The condition of a person with dementia gets worse You are unable to care for a person with dementia at home Prevention Most causes of dementia are not preventable.

        "article": " Dementia Definition Dementia is not a specific disease. It is a descriptive term for a collection of symptoms that can be caused by a number of disorders that affect the brain. People with dementia have significantly impaired intellectual functioning that interferes with normal activities and relationships. They also lose their ability to solve problems and maintain emotional control, and they may experience personality changes and behavioral problems, such as agitation, delusions, and hallucinations. While memory loss is a common symptom of dementia, memory loss by itself does not mean that a person has dementia. Doctors diagnose dementia only if two or more brain functions - such as memory and language skills -- are significantly impaired without loss of consciousness. Some of the diseases that can cause symptoms of dementia are Alzheimer\u2019s disease, vascular dementia, Lewy body dementia, frontotemporal dementia, Huntington\u2019s disease, and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. Doctors have identified other conditions that can cause dementia or dementia-like symptoms including reactions to medications, metabolic problems and endocrine abnormalities, nutritional deficiencies, infections, poisoning, brain tumors, anoxia or hypoxia (conditions in which the brain\u2019s oxygen supply is either reduced or cut off entirely), and heart and lung problems. Although it is common in very elderly individuals, dementia is not a normal part of the aging process. Treatment Drugs to specifically treat Alzheimer\u2019s disease and some other progressive dementias are now available. Although these drugs do not halt the disease or reverse existing brain damage, they can improve symptoms and slow the progression of the disease. This may improve an individual\u2019s quality of life, ease the burden on caregivers, or delay admission to a nursing home.

        "article": " Dementia Overview Dementia isn't a specific disease. Instead, dementia describes a group of symptoms affecting memory, thinking and social abilities severely enough to interfere with daily functioning. Though dementia generally involves memory loss, memory loss has different causes. So memory loss alone doesn't mean you have dementia. Alzheimer's disease is the most common cause of a progressive dementia in older adults, but there are a number of causes of dementia. Depending on the cause, some dementia symptoms can be reversed. Dementia care at Mayo Clinic Symptoms Dementia symptoms vary depending on the cause, but common signs and symptoms include: Cognitive changes - Memory loss, which is usually noticed by a spouse or someone else - Difficulty communicating or finding words - Difficulty reasoning or problem-solving - Difficulty handling complex tasks - Difficulty with planning and organizing - Difficulty with coordination and motor functions - Confusion and disorientation Psychological changes - Personality changes - Depression - Anxiety - Inappropriate behavior - Paranoia - Agitation - Hallucinations When to see a doctor See a doctor if you or a loved one has memory problems or other dementia symptoms. Some treatable medical conditions can cause dementia symptoms, so it's important to determine the underlying cause. Causes Dementia involves damage of nerve cells in the brain, which can occur in several areas of the brain. Dementia affects people differently, depending on the area of the brain affected. Dementias are often grouped by what they have in common, such as the part of the brain that's affected or whether they worsen over time (progressive dementias). Some dementias, such as those caused by a reaction to medications or vitamin deficiencies, might improve with treatment. Progressive dementias Types of dementias that progress and aren't reversible include: - Alzheimer's disease. In people age 65 and older, Alzheimer's disease is the most common cause of dementia. Although the cause of Alzheimer's disease isn't known, plaques and tangles are often found in the brains of people with Alzheimer's. Plaques are clumps of a protein called beta-amyloid, and tangles are fibrous tangles made up of tau protein. Certain genetic factors might make it more likely that people will develop Alzheimer's. - Vascular dementia. This second most common type of dementia occurs as a result of damage to the vessels that supply blood to your brain. Blood vessel problems can be caused by stroke or other blood vessel conditions. - Lewy body dementia. Lewy bodies are abnormal clumps of protein that have been found in the brains of people with Lewy body dementia, Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. This is one of the more common types of progressive dementia. - Frontotemporal dementia. This is a group of diseases characterized by the breakdown (degeneration) of nerve cells in the frontal and temporal lobes of the brain, the areas generally associated with personality, behavior and language. As with other dementias, the cause isn't known. - Mixed dementia. Autopsy studies of the brains of people 80 and older who had dementia indicate that many had a combination of Alzheimer's disease, vascular dementia and Lewy body dementia. Studies are ongoing to determine how having mixed dementia affects symptoms and treatments. Other disorders linked to dementia - Huntington's disease. Caused by a genetic mutation, this disease causes certain nerve cells in your brain and spinal cord to waste away. Signs and symptoms, including a severe decline in thinking (cognitive) skills usually appear around age 30 or 40. - Traumatic brain injury. This condition is caused by repetitive head trauma, such as experienced by boxers, football players or soldiers. Depending on the part of the brain that's injured, this condition can cause dementia signs and symptoms, such as depression, explosiveness, memory loss, uncoordinated movement and impaired speech, as well as slow movement, tremors and rigidity (parkinsonism). Symptoms might not appear until years after the trauma. - Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. This rare brain disorder usually occurs in people without known risk factors. This condition might be due to an abnormal form of a protein. Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease can be inherited or caused by exposure to diseased brain or nervous system tissue. Signs and symptoms of this fatal condition usually appear around age 60. - Parkinson's disease. Many people with Parkinson's disease eventually develop dementia symptoms (Parkinson's disease dementia). Dementia-like conditions that can be reversed Some causes of dementia or dementia-like symptoms can be reversed with treatment. They include: - Infections and immune disorders. Dementia-like symptoms can result from fever or other side effects of your body's attempt to fight off an infection. Conditions such as multiple sclerosis that result from the body's immune system attacking nerve cells also can cause dementia. - Metabolic problems and endocrine abnormalities. People with thyroid problems, low blood sugar (hypoglycemia), too little or too much sodium or calcium, or an impaired ability to absorb vitamin B-12 can develop dementia-like symptoms or other personality changes. - Nutritional deficiencies. Not drinking enough liquids (dehydration); not getting enough thiamin (vitamin B-1), which is common in people with chronic alcoholism; and not getting enough vitamins B-6 and B-12 in your diet can cause dementia-like symptoms. - Reactions to medications. A reaction to a medication or an interaction of several medications can cause dementia-like symptoms. - Subdural hematomas. Bleeding between the surface of the brain and the covering over the brain, which is common in the elderly after a fall, can cause symptoms similar to dementia. - Poisoning. Exposure to heavy metals, such as lead, and other poisons, such as pesticides, as well as alcohol abuse or recreational drug use can lead to symptoms of dementia. Symptoms might resolve with treatment. - Brain tumors. Rarely, dementia can result from damage caused by a brain tumor. - Anoxia. This condition, also called hypoxia, occurs when organ tissues aren't getting enough oxygen. Anoxia can occur due to severe asthma, heart attack, carbon monoxide poisoning or other causes. - Normal-pressure hydrocephalus. This condition, which is caused by enlarged ventricles in the brain, can cause walking problems, urinary difficulty and memory loss. Risk factors Many factors can eventually lead to dementia. Some factors, such as age, can't be changed. Others can be addressed to reduce your risk. Risk factors that can't be changed - Age. The risk rises as you age, especially after age 65. However, dementia isn't a normal part of aging, and dementia can occur in younger people. - Family history. Having a family history of dementia puts you at greater risk of developing the condition. However, many people with a family history never develop symptoms, and many people without a family history do. Tests to determine whether you have certain genetic mutations are available. - Down syndrome. By middle age, many people with Down syndrome develop early-onset Alzheimer's disease. - Mild cognitive impairment. This involves difficulties with memory but without loss of daily function. It puts people at higher risk of dementia. Risk factors you can change You might be able to control the following risk factors of dementia. - Heavy alcohol use. If you drink large amounts of alcohol, you might have a higher risk of dementia. Some studies, however, have shown that moderate amounts of alcohol might have a protective effect. - Cardiovascular risk factors. These include high blood pressure (hypertension), high cholesterol, buildup of fats in your artery walls (atherosclerosis) and obesity. - Depression. Although not yet well-understood, late-life depression might indicate the development of dementia. - Diabetes. If you have diabetes, you might have an increased risk of dementia, especially if it's poorly controlled. - Smoking. Smoking might increase your risk of developing dementia and blood vessel (vascular) diseases. - Sleep apnea. People who snore and have episodes where they frequently stop breathing while asleep may have reversible memory loss. Complications Dementia can affect many body systems and, therefore, the ability to function. Dementia can lead to: - Inadequate nutrition. Many people with dementia eventually reduce or stop their intake of nutrients. Ultimately, they may be unable to chew and swallow. - Pneumonia. Difficulty swallowing increases the risk of choking or aspirating food into the lungs, which can block breathing and cause pneumonia. - Inability to perform self-care tasks. As dementia progresses, it can interfere with bathing, dressing, brushing hair or teeth, using the toilet independently and taking medications accurately. - Personal safety challenges. Some day-to-day situations can present safety issues for people with dementia, including driving, cooking and walking alone. - Death. Late-stage dementia results in coma and death, often from infection. Diagnosis Diagnosing dementia and determining what type it is can be challenging. A diagnosis of dementia requires that at least two core mental functions be impaired enough to interfere with daily living. They are memory, language skills, ability to focus and pay attention, ability to reason and problem-solve, and visual perception. Your doctor will review your medical history and symptoms and conduct a physical examination. He or she will likely ask someone close to you about your symptoms, as well. No single test can diagnose dementia, so doctors are likely to run a number of tests that can help pinpoint the problem. Cognitive and neuropsychological tests Doctors will evaluate your thinking (cognitive) function. A number of tests measure thinking skills such as memory, orientation, reasoning and judgment, language skills, and attention. Neurological evaluation Doctors evaluate your memory, language, visual perception, attention, problem-solving, movement, senses, balance, reflexes and other areas. Brain scans - CT or MRI. These scans can check for evidence of stroke or bleeding or tumor or hydrocephalus. - PET scans. These can show patterns of brain activity and if the amyloid protein, a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease, has been deposited in the brain. Laboratory tests Simple blood tests can detect physical problems that can affect brain function, such as vitamin B-12 deficiency or an underactive thyroid gland. Sometimes the spinal fluid is examined for infection, inflammation or markers of some degenerative diseases. Psychiatric evaluation A mental health professional can determine whether depression or another mental health condition is contributing to your symptoms. Treatment Most types of dementia can't be cured, but there are ways to manage your symptoms. Medications The following are used to temporarily improve dementia symptoms. - Cholinesterase inhibitors. These medications - including donepezil (Aricept), rivastigmine (Exelon) and galantamine (Razadyne) - work by boosting levels of a chemical messenger involved in memory and judgment. Although primarily used to treat Alzheimer's disease, these medications might also be prescribed for other dementias, including vascular dementia, Parkinson's disease dementia and Lewy body dementia. Side effects can include nausea, vomiting and diarrhea. - Memantine. Memantine (Namenda) works by regulating the activity of glutamate, another chemical messenger involved in brain functions, such as learning and memory. In some cases, memantine is prescribed with a cholinesterase inhibitor. A common side effect of memantine is dizziness. - Other medications. Your doctor might prescribe medications to treat other symptoms or conditions, such as depression, sleep disturbances or agitation. Therapies Several dementia symptoms and behavior problems might be treated initially using nondrug approaches, such as: - Occupational therapy. An occupational therapist can show you how to make your home safer and teach coping behaviors. The purpose is to prevent accidents, such as falls; manage behavior; and prepare you for the dementia progression. - Modifying the environment. Reducing clutter and noise can make it easier for someone with dementia to focus and function. You might need to hide objects that can threaten safety, such as knives and car keys. Monitoring systems can alert you if the person with dementia wanders. - Modifying tasks. Break tasks into easier steps and focus on success, not failure. Structure and routine also help reduce confusion in people with dementia. Lifestyle and home remedies Dementia symptoms and behavior problems will progress over time. Caregivers might try the following suggestions: - Enhance communication. When talking with your loved one, maintain eye contact. Speak slowly in simple sentences, and don't rush the response. Present one idea or instruction at a time. Use gestures and cues, such as pointing to objects. - Encourage exercise. Exercise benefits everyone, including people with dementia. The main benefits of exercise include improved strength and cardiovascular health. There is growing evidence that exercise also protects the brain from dementia, especially when combined with a healthy diet and treatment for risk factors for cardiovascular disease. Some research also shows physical activity might slow the progression of impaired thinking in people with Alzheimer's disease. And it can lessen symptoms of depression. - Encourage activity. Plan activities the person with dementia enjoys and can do. Dancing, painting, gardening, cooking, singing and others can be fun, can help you connect with your loved one, and can help your loved one focus on what he or she can still do. - Establish a nighttime ritual. Behavior is often worse at night. Try to establish going-to-bed rituals that are calming and away from the noise of television, meal cleanup and active family members. Leave nightlights on in the bedroom, hall and bathroom to prevent disorientation. Limiting caffeine, discouraging napping and offering opportunities for exercise during the day might ease nighttime restlessness. - Encourage keeping a calendar. A calendar might help your loved one remember upcoming events, daily activities and medication schedules. Consider sharing a calendar with your loved one. - Plan for the future. Develop a plan with your loved one while he or she is able to participate that identifies goals for future care. Support groups, legal advisers, family members and others might be able to help. You'll need to consider financial and legal issues, safety and daily living concerns, and long-term care options. Alternative medicine Several dietary supplements, herbal remedies and therapies have been studied for people with dementia. Some may be beneficial. Use caution when considering taking dietary supplements, vitamins or herbal remedies, especially if you're taking other medications. These remedies aren't regulated, and claims about their benefits aren't always based on scientific research. Some alternative medicines for Alzheimer's disease and other forms of dementia that have been studied include: - Vitamin E. Evidence for taking vitamin E to slow Alzheimer disease is soft. Doctors warn against taking large doses of vitamin E because it may have a higher risk of mortality, especially in people with heart disease. - Omega-3 fatty acids. There is some evidence that eating fish three times a week might lower your risk of dementia. However, in clinical studies, omega-3 fatty acids haven't significantly slowed cognitive decline in mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease. More research is needed. - Ginkgo. Although ginkgo is considered safe, study results have been inconsistent in determining whether ginkgo helps people with dementia. The following techniques may help reduce agitation and promote relaxation in people with dementia. - Music therapy, which involves listening to soothing music - Pet therapy, which involves use of animals, such as visits from dogs, to promote improved moods and behaviors in people with dementia - Aromatherapy, which uses fragrant plant oils - Massage therapy - Art therapy, which involves creating art, focusing on the process rather than the outcome Other therapies The following techniques may help reduce agitation and promote relaxation in people with dementia. - Music therapy, which involves listening to soothing music - Pet therapy, which involves use of animals, such as visits from dogs, to promote improved moods and behaviors in people with dementia - Aromatherapy, which uses fragrant plant oils - Massage therapy - Art therapy, which involves creating art, focusing on the process rather than the outcome ",

        "section": "Dementia (WHAT IS VASCULAR DEMENTIA?): Vascular dementia, considered the second most common form of dementia after Alzheimer's disease, and vascular cognitive impairment (VCI) result from injuries to the vessels supplying blood to the brain, often after a stroke or series of strokes. Vascular dementia and VCI arise as a result of risk factors that similarly increase the risk for cerebrovascular disease (such as stroke), including atrial fibrillation, hypertension (high blood pressure), diabetes, and high cholesterol. The symptoms of vascular dementia can be similar to those of Alzheimer's, and both conditions can occur at the same time. Symptoms of vascular dementia can begin suddenly and worsen or improve during one's lifetime.This type of dementia is often managed with drugs to prevent strokes. The aim is to reduce the risk of additional brain damage. Some studies suggest that drugs that improve memory in Alzheimer's disease might benefit people with early vascular dementia. Interventions that address risk factors may be incorporated into the management of vascular dementia.Some types of vascular dementia include:Multi-infarct dementia. This type of dementia occurs when a person has had many small strokes that damage brain cells. One side of the body may be disproportionally affected, and multi-infarct dementia may impair language or other functions, depending on the region of the brain that is affected. When the strokes occur on both sides of the brain, dementia is more likely than when stroke occurs on one side of the brain. In some cases, a single stroke can damage the brain enough to cause dementia. This so-called single-infarct dementia is more common when stroke affects the left side of the brain-where speech centers are located-and/or when it involves the hippocampus, the part of the brain that is vital for memory.Cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL). This inherited form of cardiovascular disease results in a thickening of the walls of small- and medium-sized blood vessels, eventually stemming the flow of blood to the brain. It is associated with mutations of a gene called Notch3. CADASIL is associated with multi-infarct dementia, stroke, migraine with aura (migraine preceded by visual symptoms), and mood disorders. The first symptoms can appear in people between ages 20 and 40. Many people with CADASIL are undiagnosed. People with first-degree relatives who have CADASIL can be tested for genetic mutations to the Notch3 gene to determine their own risk of developing CADASIL.Subcortical vascular dementia, also called Binswanger's disease. This rare form of dementia involves extensive damage to the small blood vessels and nerve fibers that make up white matter, the \"network\" part of the brain believed to be critical for relaying messages between regions. The symptoms of Binswanger's are related to the disruption of subcortical neural circuits involving short-term memory, organization, mood, attention, decision making, and appropriate behavior. A characteristic feature of this disease is psychomotor slowness, such as an increase in the time it takes for a person to think of a letter and then write it on a piece of paper.For more information about vascular dementia and VCI, see NIA's list of resources.",

Help them have good quality of life as they're dying. General As they reach the end of life, people suffering from dementia can present special challenges for caregivers. People can live with diseases such as Alzheimer's or Parkinson's dementia for years, so it can be hard to think of these as terminal diseases. But, they do cause death. Hard Decisions Dementia causes the gradual loss of thinking, remembering, and reasoning abilities, making it difficult for those who want to provide supportive care at the end of life to know what is needed. Because people with advanced dementia can no longer communicate clearly, they cannot share their concerns. Is Uncle Bert refusing food because he's not hungry or because he's confused? Why does Grandma Sakura seem agitated? Is she in pain and needs medication to relieve it, but can't tell you?As these conditions progress, caregivers may find it hard to provide emotional or spiritual comfort. How can you let Grandpa know how much his life has meant to you? How do you make peace with your mother if she no longer knows who you are? Someone who has severe memory loss might not take spiritual comfort from sharing family memories or understand when others express what an important part of their life this person has been. Palliative care or hospice can be helpful in many ways to families of people with dementia.Sensory connections-targeting someone's senses, like hearing, touch, or sight-can bring comfort. Being touched or massaged can be soothing. Listening to music, white noise, or sounds from nature seem to relax some people and lessen their agitation.When a dementia like Alzheimer's disease is first diagnosed, if everyone understands that there is no cure, then plans for the end of life can be made before thinking and speaking abilities fail and the person with Alzheimer's can no longer legally complete documents like advance directives.Learn more about legal and financial planning for people with Alzheimer's disease.End-of-life care decisions are more complicated for caregivers if the dying person has not expressed the kind of care he or she would prefer. Someone newly diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease might not be able to imagine the later stages of the disease. Weighing Care Choices Quality of life is an important issue when making healthcare decisions for people with dementia. For example, medicines are available that may delay or keep symptoms from becoming worse for a little while. Medicines also may help control some behavioral symptoms in people with mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease.However, some caregivers might not want drugs prescribed for people in the later stages of Alzheimer's. They may believe that the person's quality of life is already so poor that the medicine is unlikely to make a difference. If the drug has serious side effects, they may be even more likely to decide against it.When making care decisions for someone else near the end of life, consider the goals of care and weigh the benefits, risks, and side effects of the treatment. You may have to make a treatment decision based on the person's comfort at one end of the spectrum and extending life or maintaining abilities for a little longer at the other.With dementia, a person's body may continue to be physically healthy while his or her thinking and memory are deteriorating. This means that caregivers and family members may be faced with very difficult decisions about how treatments that maintain physical health, such as installing a pacemaker, fit within the care goals. Dementia\u2019s Unpredictable Progression Dementia often progresses slowly and unpredictably. Experts suggest that signs of the final stage of Alzheimer's disease include some of the following:- Being unable to move around on one's own - Being unable to speak or make oneself understood - Needing help with most, if not all, daily activities, such as eating and self-care - Eating problems such as difficulty swallowingBecause of their unique experience with what happens at the end of life, hospice and palliative care experts might be able to help identify when someone in the final stage of Alzheimer's disease is in the last days or weeks of life. Caregiver Support Caring for people with Alzheimer's or other dementias at home can be demanding and stressful for the family caregiver. Depression is a problem for some family caregivers, as is fatigue, because many feel they are always on call. Family caregivers may have to cut back on work hours or leave work altogether because of their caregiving responsibilities.Many family members taking care of a person with advanced dementia at home feel relief when death happens-for themselves and for the person who died. It is important to realize such feelings are normal. Hospice-whether used at home or in a facility (such as a nursing home)-gives family caregivers needed support near the end of life, as well as help with their grief, both before and after their family member dies.Caregivers, ask for help when you need it. Learn about respite care.Questions to Ask About End-of-Life Care for a Person with Dementia You will want to understand how the available medical options presented by the healthcare team fit into your family's particular needs. You might want to ask questions such as: - How will the approach the doctor is suggesting affect your relative's quality of life? Will it make a difference in comfort and well-being? - If considering home hospice for your relative with dementia, what will be needed to care for him or her? Does the facility have special experience with people with dementia? - What can I expect as the disease gets worse?Read about this topic in Spanish. Lea sobre este tema en espanol. WHAT IS MIXED DEMENTIA? Read about mixed dementia, a combination of two or more disorders. For example, older adults with dementia may have Alzheimer's and vascular dementia. General It is common for people to have mixed dementia-a combination of two or more disorders, at least one of which is dementia. A number of combinations are possible. For example, some people have both Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia.Some studies indicate that mixed dementia is the most common cause of dementia in the elderly. For example, autopsy studies looking at the brains of people who had dementia indicate that most people age 80 and older had mixed dementia-a combination of brain changes related to Alzheimer's disease (amyloid and tau), cerebrovascular disease (such as stroke), and, in some instances, Lewy body dementia (Lewy bodies). These studies suggest that mixed dementia is caused by both Alzheimer's-related neurodegenerative processes and vascular disease-related processes.In a person with mixed dementia, it may not be clear exactly how many of a person's symptoms are due to Alzheimer's or another type of dementia. In one study, approximately 40 percent of people who were thought to have Alzheimer's were found after autopsy to also have some form of cerebrovascular disease. In addition, several studies have found that many of the major risk factors for vascular disease also may be risk factors for Alzheimer's disease.Researchers are still working to understand how underlying disease processes in mixed dementia influence each other. It is not clear, for example, if symptoms are likely to be worse when a person has brain changes reflecting multiple types of dementia. Nor do we know if a person with multiple dementias can benefit from treating one type, for example, when a person with Alzheimer's controls high blood pressure and other vascular disease risk factors.

Nor do we know if a person with multiple dementias can benefit from treating one type, for example, when a person with Alzheimer's controls high blood pressure and other vascular disease risk factors. WHAT IS VASCULAR DEMENTIA? Vascular dementia differs from Alzheimer's disease in that it is caused by stroke. Learn about types of vascular dementia as well as treatment. General Vascular dementia, considered the second most common form of dementia after Alzheimer's disease, and vascular cognitive impairment (VCI) result from injuries to the vessels supplying blood to the brain, often after a stroke or series of strokes. Vascular dementia and VCI arise as a result of risk factors that similarly increase the risk for cerebrovascular disease (such as stroke), including atrial fibrillation, hypertension (high blood pressure), diabetes, and high cholesterol. The symptoms of vascular dementia can be similar to those of Alzheimer's, and both conditions can occur at the same time. Symptoms of vascular dementia can begin suddenly and worsen or improve during one's lifetime.This type of dementia is often managed with drugs to prevent strokes. The aim is to reduce the risk of additional brain damage. Some studies suggest that drugs that improve memory in Alzheimer's disease might benefit people with early vascular dementia. Interventions that address risk factors may be incorporated into the management of vascular dementia.Some types of vascular dementia include:Multi-infarct dementia. This type of dementia occurs when a person has had many small strokes that damage brain cells. One side of the body may be disproportionally affected, and multi-infarct dementia may impair language or other functions, depending on the region of the brain that is affected. When the strokes occur on both sides of the brain, dementia is more likely than when stroke occurs on one side of the brain. In some cases, a single stroke can damage the brain enough to cause dementia. This so-called single-infarct dementia is more common when stroke affects the left side of the brain-where speech centers are located-and/or when it involves the hippocampus, the part of the brain that is vital for memory.Cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL). This inherited form of cardiovascular disease results in a thickening of the walls of small- and medium-sized blood vessels, eventually stemming the flow of blood to the brain. It is associated with mutations of a gene called Notch3. CADASIL is associated with multi-infarct dementia, stroke, migraine with aura (migraine preceded by visual symptoms), and mood disorders. The first symptoms can appear in people between ages 20 and 40. Many people with CADASIL are undiagnosed. People with first-degree relatives who have CADASIL can be tested for genetic mutations to the Notch3 gene to determine their own risk of developing CADASIL.Subcortical vascular dementia, also called Binswanger's disease. This rare form of dementia involves extensive damage to the small blood vessels and nerve fibers that make up white matter, the \"network\" part of the brain believed to be critical for relaying messages between regions. The symptoms of Binswanger's are related to the disruption of subcortical neural circuits involving short-term memory, organization, mood, attention, decision making, and appropriate behavior. A characteristic feature of this disease is psychomotor slowness, such as an increase in the time it takes for a person to think of a letter and then write it on a piece of paper.For more information about vascular dementia and VCI, see NIA's list of resources.

GETTING HELP WITH ALZHEIMER'S CAREGIVING Looking for respite care or help with Alzheimer's caregiving? Learn about supportive resources like home care, adult day care, meal services, and hospice. General Some caregivers need help when the person is in the early stages of Alzheimer's disease. Other caregivers look for help when the person is in the later stages of Alzheimer's. It's okay to seek help whenever you need it.As the person moves through the stages of Alzheimer's, he or she will need more care. One reason is that medicines used to treat Alzheimer's disease can only control symptoms; they cannot cure the disease. Symptoms, such as memory loss and confusion, will get worse over time.Because of this, you will need more help. You may feel that asking for help shows weakness or a lack of caring, but the opposite is true. Asking for help shows your strength. It means you know your limits and when to seek support. Build a Support System According to many caregivers, building a local support system is a key way to get help. Your support system might include a caregiver support group, the local chapter of the Alzheimer's Association, family, friends, and faith groups.

Learn about other dementias, including Lewy body dementia, frontotemporal disorders, vascular dementia, and mixed dementia. General Various disorders and factors contribute to the development of dementia. Neurodegenerative disorders result in a progressive and irreversible loss of neurons and brain functioning. Currently, there are no cures for these types of disorders. They include:- Alzheimer's disease - Frontotemporal disorders - Lewy body dementiaOther types of progressive brain disease include:- Vascular dementia and vascular cognitive impairment - Mixed dementia, a combination of two or more disorders, at least one of which is dementiaOther types of dementia can often be halted or even reversed with treatment. For example, normal pressure hydrocephalus, an abnormal buildup of cerebrospinal fluid in the brain, often resolves with treatment.In addition, certain medical conditions can cause serious memory problems that resemble dementia. These problems should go away once the conditions are treated. These conditions include:- Side effects of certain medicines - Depression - Certain vitamin deficiencies - Drinking too much alcohol - Blood clots or tumors in the brain - Head injury, such as a concussion from a fall or accident - Thyroid, kidney, or liver problemsDoctors have identified many other conditions that can cause dementia or dementia-like symptoms. These conditions include:- Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, a rare brain disorder - Huntington's disease, a hereditary disorder caused by a faulty gene - Chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), caused by repeated traumatic brain injury - Subdural hematoma, bleeding between the brain's surface and its outer coveringThe overlap in symptoms of various dementias can make it hard to get an accurate diagnosis. But a proper diagnosis is important to get the right treatment. Seek help from a neurologist-a doctor who specializes in disorders of the brain and nervous system-or other medical specialist who knows about dementia.Learn more about dementia from MedlinePlus.

WHAT IS DEMENTIA? Dementia is a loss of thinking, remembering, and reasoning skills that interferes with a person's daily life and activities. While dementia is more common with advanced age, it is not a normal part of aging. Learn why. General Dementia is the loss of cognitive functioning-thinking, remembering, and reasoning-and behavioral abilities to such an extent that it interferes with a person's daily life and activities. Dementia ranges in severity from the mildest stage, when it is just beginning to affect a person's functioning, to the most severe stage, when the person must depend completely on others for basic activities of living.Signs and symptoms of dementia result when once-healthy neurons (nerve cells) in the brain stop working, lose connections with other brain cells, and die. While everyone loses some neurons as they age, people with dementia experience far greater loss.While dementia is more common as people grow older (up to half of all people age 85 or older may have some form of dementia), it is not a normal part of aging. Many people live into their 90s and beyond without any signs of dementia. One type of dementia, frontotemporal disorders, is more common in middle-aged than older adults.Memory loss, though common, is not the only sign of dementia. For a person to have dementia, he or she must have:- Two or more core mental functions that are impaired. These functions include memory, language skills, visual perception, and the ability to focus and pay attention. These also include cognitive skills such as the ability to reason and solve problems. - A loss of brain function severe enough that a person cannot do normal, everyday tasksIn addition, some people with dementia cannot control their emotions. Their personalities may change. They can have delusions, which are strong beliefs without proof, such as the idea that someone is stealing from them. They also may hallucinate, seeing or otherwise experiencing things that are not real.The causes of dementia can vary, depending on the types of brain changes that may be taking place. Other dementias include Lewy body dementia, frontotemporal disorders, and vascular dementia. It is common for people to have mixed dementia-a combination of two or more disorders, at least one of which is dementia.

ASSESSING CHANGES IN MEMORY AND FUNCTION When visiting an aging relative, you might notice they have more memory problems than last time. Find info to help you assess changes in memory and cognition. General If you do not see an aging friend or relative often, changes in his or her health may seem dramatic. In contrast, the primary caregiver might not notice such changes or realize that more help, medical treatment, or supervision is needed. Or, the primary caregiver might not want to accept the fact that the health of his or her spouse or parent is failing. Sometimes a geriatric care manager or other professional is the first to notice changes.For families dealing with Alzheimer's disease or another dementia, it can be easier to cover for the person-doing things for him or her, filling in information in conversations, and so on-than to acknowledge what is happening.As a caregiver, you can provide support by helping an aging friend or relative get the care they need.A few good questions to help you start the conversation with the primary caregiver are:- If you thought there might be a change in Aunt Joan's condition, whose opinion would you seek? - I didn't notice Dad repeating himself so much the last time I was here. Do you remember when it started?Some changes may not be what you think. Occasional forgetfulness does not necessarily indicate dementia. Before you raise the issue of what needs to be done, talk to your parent and the primary caregiver about your concerns.Try not to sound critical when you raise the subject. Instead, mention your particular worry, for example, \"Mom, it looks like you don't have much food in the house-are you having trouble getting to the store?\" and explain why you are asking. Listen to what the primary caregiver says about the situation and whether he or she believes there are problems.Discuss what you think could be done. For example, you could ask:- Would you like me to arrange to have groceries delivered on a regular basis? - Do we need to get a second opinion about the diagnosis? - Can you follow the medication schedule? - Would you like some help with housework?Try to follow your suggestions with practical help, and give specific examples of what you can do. For example, you might arrange to have a personal or home health aide come in once a week. You might schedule doctors' appointments or arrange for transportation.In some cases, you may have to be forceful, especially if you feel that the situation is unhealthy or unsafe. Do not leave a frail adult at risk. If you have to act against the wishes of your parent or the primary caregiver, be direct and explain what you are going to do. Discuss your plan, and say why you are taking action.Find more tips for long-distance caregivers. DIAGNOSING DEMENTIA Doctors diagnose dementia-including Alzheimer disease, Lewy body dementia, and frontotemporal dementia-with brain scans and other tests. General To diagnose dementia, doctors first assess whether a person has an underlying treatable condition such as depression, abnormal thyroid function, normal pressure hydrocephalus, or vitamin B12 deficiency. Early diagnosis is important, as some causes for symptoms can be treated. In many cases, the specific type of dementia a person has may not be confirmed until after the person has died and the brain is examined.A medical assessment for dementia generally includes:- Patient history. Typical questions about a person's medical and family history might include asking about whether dementia runs in the family, how and when symptoms began, changes in behavior and personality, and if the person is taking certain medications that might cause or worsen symptoms. - Physical exam. Measuring blood pressure and other vital signs may help physicians detect conditions that might cause or occur with dementia. Such conditions may be treatable. - Neurological tests. Assessing balance, sensory function, reflexes, vision, eye movements, and other cognitive functions helps identify conditions that may affect the diagnosis or are treatable with drugs. Tests Used to Diagnose Dementia The following procedures also may be used to diagnose dementia:- Cognitive and neuropsychological tests. These tests measure memory, problem solving, attention, counting, language skills, and other abilities related to mental functioning. - Laboratory tests. Blood and urine tests can help find or rule out possible causes of symptoms. - Brain scans. These tests can identify strokes, tumors, and other problems that can cause dementia. Scans also identify changes in the brain's structure and function. The most common scans are: - Computed tomography (CT), which uses X-rays to produce images of the brain and other organs - Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which uses magnetic fields and radio waves to produce detailed images of body structures, including tissues, organs, bones, and nerves - Positron emission tomography (PET), which uses radiation to provide pictures of brain activity - Psychiatric evaluation. This evaluation will help determine if depression or another mental health condition is causing or contributing to a person's symptoms. - Genetic tests. Some dementias are caused by a known gene defect. In these cases, a genetic test can help people know if they are at risk for dementia. People should talk with family members, a primary care doctor, and a genetic counselor before getting tested. Who Can Diagnose Dementia? Visiting a family doctor is often the first step for people who are experiencing changes in thinking, movement, or behavior. However, neurologists-doctors who specialize in disorders of the brain and nervous system-generally have the expertise needed to diagnose dementia. Geriatric psychiatrists, neuropsychologists, and geriatricians may also be skilled in diagnosing the condition.If a specialist cannot be found in your community, ask the neurology department of the nearest medical school for a referral. A hospital affiliated with a medical school may also have a dementia or movement disorders clinic that provides expert evaluation. ",

This disorder affects the retina, the specialized light-sensitive tissue that lines the back of the eye. Specifically, vitelliform macular dystrophy disrupts cells in a small area near the center of the retina called the macula. The macula is responsible for sharp central vision, which is needed for detailed tasks such as reading, driving, and recognizing faces.   Vitelliform macular dystrophy causes a fatty yellow pigment (lipofuscin) to build up in cells underlying the macula. Over time, the abnormal accumulation of this substance can damage cells that are critical for clear central vision. As a result, people with this disorder often lose their central vision, and their eyesight may become blurry or distorted. Vitelliform macular dystrophy typically does not affect side (peripheral) vision or the ability to see at night.   Researchers have described two forms of vitelliform macular dystrophy with similar features. The early-onset form (known as Best disease) usually appears in childhood; the onset of symptoms and the severity of vision loss vary widely. The adult-onset form begins later, usually in mid-adulthood, and tends to cause vision loss that worsens slowly over time. The two forms of vitelliform macular dystrophy each have characteristic changes in the macula that can be detected during an eye examination. Vitelliform macular dystrophy is a rare disorder; its incidence is unknown. Mutations in the BEST1 and PRPH2 genes cause vitelliform macular dystrophy. BEST1 mutations are responsible for Best disease and for some cases of the adult-onset form of vitelliform macular dystrophy. Changes in the PRPH2 gene can also cause the adult-onset form of vitelliform macular dystrophy; however, less than a quarter of all people with this form of the condition have mutations in the BEST1 or PRPH2 gene. In most cases, the cause of the adult-onset form is unknown.   The BEST1 gene provides instructions for making a protein called bestrophin. This protein acts as a channel that controls the movement of charged chlorine atoms (chloride ions) into or out of cells in the retina. Mutations in the BEST1 gene probably lead to the production of an abnormally shaped channel that cannot properly regulate the flow of chloride. Researchers have not determined how these malfunctioning channels are related to the buildup of lipofuscin in the macula and progressive vision loss.   The PRPH2 gene provides instructions for making a protein called peripherin 2. This protein is essential for the normal function of light-sensing (photoreceptor) cells in the retina. Mutations in the PRPH2 gene cause vision loss by disrupting structures in these cells that contain light-sensing pigments. It is unclear why PRPH2 mutations affect only central vision in people with adult-onset vitelliform macular dystrophy. Best disease is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. In most cases, an affected person has one parent with the condition.   The inheritance pattern of adult-onset vitelliform macular dystrophy is uncertain. Some studies have suggested that this disorder may be inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern.

It usually begins in childhood or adolescence, but age of onset and severity of vision loss can vary. Affected people first have normal vision, followed by decreased central visual acuity and distorted vision (metamorphopsia). Peripheral vision is not affected. [1] BVMD is characterized by atrophy of the retinal pigment epithelium\u00a0(The retina is the back part of the eye that contains the specialized cells that respond to light, known as \u00a0photoreceptors) and impaired central visual function. [2]\u00a0BVMD is usually inherited in an autosomal dominant manner, but autosomal recessive inheritance has been reported. The condition is typically caused by mutations in the BEST1 gene ; in a few cases the cause is unknown. Treatment is symptomatic and involves the use of low vision aids, and direct laser treatment or photodynamic therapy.\u00a0Newer treatment includes anti-VEGF agents ( bevacizumab) and transcorneal electrical retinal stimulation. [1] The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) provides the following list of features that have been reported in people with this condition. Much of the information in the HPO comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. If available, the list includes a rough estimate of how common a feature is (its frequency). Frequencies are based on a specific study and may not be representative of all studies. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary for definitions of the terms below. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Cystoid macular degeneration Very frequent Metamorphopsia Very frequent Visual impairment Very frequent Abnormality of color vision Frequent Choroideremia Occasional Visual field defect Occasional Abnormal electroretinogram - Autosomal dominant inheritance - Macular dystrophy - Reduced visual acuity - Best vitelliform macular dystrophy (BVMD) is caused by changes ( mutations ) in the gene . [1] This gene gives the body instructions for making a protein called bestrophin. Bestrophin acts as a channel that controls the movement of chloride ions within the retina. It is thought that mutations in the BEST1 gene affect the shape of the channel and its ability to properly regulate the flow of chloride. However, it is unclear how exactly this relates to the specific features of BVMD. [3] Best vitelliform macular dystrophy (BVMD) is most commonly inherited in an autosomal dominant manner, although a few cases with autosomal recessive inheritance have been reported. [1] In autosomal dominant inheritance, having one changed ( mutated ) copy of the responsible gene in each cell is enough to cause symptoms of the condition. When a person with an autosomal dominant condition has children, each child has a 50% (1 in 2) chance to inherit the mutated gene. Most people with BVMD have an affected parent, but some people have the condition as the result of a new mutation that occurred for the first time. [1] Autosomal recessive inheritance means that a person must have a mutation in both copies of the responsible gene in each cell to be affected. The parents of an affected person usually each carry one mutated copy of the gene and are referred to as carriers . Carriers typically do not show signs or symptoms of the condition. When two carriers of an autosomal recessive condition have children, each child has a 25% (1 in 4) risk to have the condition, a 50% (1 in 2) risk to be a carrier like each of the parents, and a 25% chance to not have the condition and not be a carrier. Best vitelliform macular dystrophy (BVMD) may be diagnosed based on the findings on an exam of the fundus (the interior surface of the eye opposite the lens); an electrooculogram (EOG); and the family history . An eye exam may include other tests as well. A fundus exam may show a typical yellow yolk-like macular lesion. The EOG, which reflects the retinal pigmentary epithelium function, is the most diagnostic test for evaluating vitelliform macular dystrophy. In the majority of the cases, a severe decrease occurs in light response, reflected by an Arden (light-peak/dark-trough) ratio of 1.1-1.5. (The normal Arden ratio is 1.8.) Carriers will also have an abnormal EOG result. \u00a0No correlation exists between EOG result and disease stage, visual acuity, or patient age. EOG results are usually symmetric for both eyes. [4] The family history in affected people is often consistent with either autosomal dominant or autosomal recessive inheritance. [1] Genetic testing may also be used to make a diagnosis of BVMD. A BEST1 mutation is detected in about 96% of affected people who have an affected family member. In people with no family history of BVMD, the mutation detection rate ranges between 50-70%. A mutation in BEST1 gene is more probable when a vitelliform lesion is accompanied by a reduced Arden ratio on EOG testing.\u00a0The exact type of genetic test ordered to confirm a diagnosis may depend on a person's ancestry, family history, and/or whether other eye disorders are also being considered. [1] There is no specific treatment for Best vitelliform macular dystrophy (BVMD) at this time. [5] [4] Low vision aids help affected people with significant loss of visual acuity. [6] Laser photocoagulation,\u00a0photodynamic therapy, and anti-VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor) agents such as bevacizumab have shown limited success in treating some of the secondary features of BVMD such as choroidal neovascularization (when abnormal blood vessels grow under the macula and retina).

AVMD affects an area of the retina called the macula, which is responsible for sharp central vision. The condition causes a fatty yellow pigment to accumulate in cells underlying the macula, eventually damaging the cells. [1] AVMD usually begins after age 40. Some people remain without symptoms throughout their life. Other people with AVMD may slowly develop blurred and/or distorted vision, that can progress to central vision loss over time. [1] [2] In the past, AVMD was believed to be mainly a genetic disorder caused by mutations in the PRPH2, BEST1, IMPG1, and IMPG2 genes ; however, recent studies focused on genetic testing suggest that the genetic cause for most cases of AVMD has not been found. [2] [3] Sometimes AVMD clearly runs in families in an autosomal dominant manner, but the inheritance is suspected to be more complicated in the majority of cases. [1] [2] Symptoms Signs and symptoms of adult-onset vitelliform macular dystrophy typically begin during mid-adulthood, in the fourth or fifth decade of life. At the time of diagnosis, mild blurring or mildly distorted vision may be present. In most cases, the cells underlying the macula become more damaged over time, which can cause slowly progressive vision loss. The condition is usually affects both eyes. [2] [3] It usually does not affect peripheral vision or the ability to see at night. [1] Studies have revealed much variability in the signs, symptoms and progression of this condition. Some people with AVMD do not have any visual symptoms throughout their life. Others may experience ongoing visual loss, but for most people the vision loss is not severe. In general, the long-term outlook ( prognosis ) is usually good, but loss of central visual function is possible. [2] [3] This table lists symptoms that people with this disease may have.

More studies are needed to better define other underlying causes that might be present, whether of genetic or environmental origin. [2] [3] Currently known genetic causes include mutations in the PRPH2, BEST1, IMPG1, and IMPG2 genes . It is additionally suspected that AVMD might be associated with a single-nucleotide polymorphism (variant DNA sequence ) in the HTRA1 gene. Single- nucleotide polymorphisms in the HTRA1 gene are additionally associated with age-related macular degeneration. [2] [3] Inheritance The majority of cases with an identified family history or genetic cause are inherited in an autosomal dominant mutation ) in one copy of the responsible gene in each cell . In some cases, an affected person inherits the mutation from an affected parent. Other cases may result from a new ( de novo ) mutation in the gene. These cases occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family. When caused by a known mutation inherited in an autosomal dominant manner, a person with adult-onset macular dystrophy (AVMD) has a 50% chance with each pregnancy of passing along the altered gene to his or her child. The inheritance pattern of AVMD can be confusing as not all individuals with AVMD have a family history and not all individuals who inherit a causative gene mutation develop symptoms. [1] Diagnosis Making a diagnosis for a genetic or rare disease can often be challenging. Healthcare professionals typically look at a person's medical history, symptoms, physical exam, and laboratory test results in order to make a diagnosis. The following resources provide information relating to diagnosis and testing for this condition. If you have questions about getting a diagnosis, you should contact a healthcare professional. Testing Resources Orphanet lists international laboratories offering diagnostic testing for this condition. Treatment There is no cure or known treatment to stop the progression of adult-onset vitelliform macular dystrophy. [2] Management usually includes a comprehensive eye examination once or twice a year to monitor progression of the disease and for complications such as choroidal neovascularization ( CNV ). [4] CNV is sometimes associated with adult-onset vitelliform macular dystrophy because macular degeneration can damage the retinal layers. When this happens, the vascular layer of the eye between the sclera and the retina known as the choroid may produce new blood vessels (neovascularization) which grow up through the damaged layers and leak or bleed into the retina.

Factors affecting this choice include your wishes, other conditions and abilities, such as whether you're able to change bandages. Medications and wound healing products For major burns, various medications and products are used to encourage healing. - Water-based treatments. Your care team may use techniques such as ultrasound mist therapy to clean and stimulate the wound tissue. - Fluids to prevent dehydration. You may need intravenous (IV) fluids to prevent dehydration and organ failure. - Pain and anxiety medications. Healing burns can be incredibly painful. You may need morphine and anti-anxiety medications - particularly for dressing changes. - Burn creams and ointments. Your care team can select from a variety of topical products for wound healing. These help keep the wound moist, reduce pain, prevent infection and speed healing. - Dressings. Your care team may also use various specialty wound dressings. These create a moist environment that fights infection and helps the burn heal. - Drugs that fight infection. If you develop an infection, you may need IV antibiotics. - Tetanus shot. Your doctor might recommend a tetanus shot after a burn injury. Physical and occupational therapy If the burned area is large, especially if it covers any joints, you may need physical therapy exercises. These can help stretch the skin so the joints can remain flexible. Other types of exercises can improve muscle strength and coordination. And occupational therapy may help if you have difficulty doing your normal daily activities. Surgical and other procedures You may need one or more of the following procedures: - Breathing assistance. If you've been burned on the face or neck, your throat may swell shut. If that appears likely, your doctor may insert a tube down your windpipe (trachea) to keep oxygen supplied to your lungs. - Tube feeding. Your metabolism goes into overdrive when your body starts trying to heal your burns. To provide adequate nutrition for this task, you doctor may thread a feeding tube through your nose to your stomach. - Easing blood flow around the wound. If a burn scab (eschar) goes completely around a limb, it can tighten and cut off the blood circulation. A scab (eschar) that goes completely around the chest can make it difficult to breathe. Your doctor may cut the eschar in several places to relieve this pressure. This procedure is called decompression. - Skin grafts. A skin graft is a surgical procedure in which sections of your own healthy skin are used to replace the scar tissue caused by deep burns. Donor skin from cadavers or pigs can be used as a temporary solution. - Plastic surgery. Plastic surgery (reconstruction) can improve the appearance of burn scars and increase the flexibility of joints affected by scarring.",
        "article": " Burns Overview Burns can be minor medical problems or life-threatening emergencies. Many people die each year from fire-related burn injuries. Electricity and chemicals also cause severe burns. Scalding liquids are the most common cause of burns in children. Treatment of burns depends on the location and severity of the injury. Sunburns and small scalds can usually be treated at home. Deep or widespread burns need immediate medical attention. People with severe burns often require treatment at specialized burn centers. They may need skin grafts to cover large wounds or to minimize scarring with deep wounds. And they may need emotional support and months of follow-up care, such as physical therapy. Symptoms Burns don't affect the skin uniformly, so a single injury can reach varying depths. Distinguishing a minor burn from a more serious burn involves determining the extent of tissue damage. The following are three classifications of burns: - First-degree burn. This minor burn affects only the outer layer of the skin (epidermis). It may cause redness, swelling and pain. It usually heals with first-aid measures within several days to a week. Sunburn is a classic example. - Second-degree burn. This type of burn affects both the epidermis and the second layer of skin (dermis). It may cause red, white or splotchy skin, pain, and swelling. And the wound often looks wet or moist. Blisters may develop, and pain can be severe. Deep second-degree burns can cause scarring. - Third-degree burn. This burn reaches into the fat layer beneath the skin. Burned areas may be charred black or white. The skin may look waxy or leathery. Third-degree burns can destroy nerves, causing numbness. A person with this type of burn may also have difficulty breathing or experience smoke inhalation or carbon monoxide poisoning. When to see a doctor Seek emergency medical assistance for: - Burns that cover the hands, feet, face, groin, buttocks, a major joint or a large area of the body - Deep burns, which means burns affecting all layers of the skin and even other tissues - Burns caused by chemicals or electricity - Difficulty breathing or burns to the airway Minor burns can be cared for at home, but call your doctor if you experience: - Large blisters - Signs of infection, such as oozing from the wound, increased pain, redness and swelling - A burn or blister that doesn't heal in several weeks - New, unexplained symptoms - Significant scarring Causes Many things can cause burns, including: - Fire - Hot liquid or steam - Hot metal, glass or other objects - Electrical currents - Radiation from X-rays or radiation therapy to treat cancer - Sunlight or ultraviolet light from a sunlamp or tanning bed - Chemicals such as strong acids, lye, paint thinner or gasoline - Abuse Complications Deep or widespread burns can lead to many complications, including: - Infection. Burns can leave skin vulnerable to bacterial infection and increase your risk of sepsis. Sepsis is a life-threatening infection that travels through the bloodstream and affects your whole body. It progresses rapidly and can cause shock and organ failure. - Low blood volume. Burns can damage blood vessels and cause fluid loss. This may result in low blood volume (hypovolemia). Severe blood and fluid loss prevents the heart from pumping enough blood to the body. - Dangerously low body temperature. The skin helps control the body's temperature, so when a large portion of the skin is injured, you lose body heat. This increases your risk of a dangerously low body temperature (hypothermia). Hypothermia is a condition in which the body loses heat faster than it can produce heat. - Breathing problems. Breathing hot air or smoke can burn airways and cause breathing (respiratory) difficulties. Smoke inhalation damages the lungs and can cause respiratory failure. - Scarring. Burns can cause scars and ridged areas caused by an overgrowth of scar tissue (keloids). - Bone and joint problems. Deep burns can limit movement of the bones and joints. Scar tissue can form and cause shortening and tightening of skin, muscles or tendons (contractures). This condition may permanently pull joints out of position. Diagnosis During the physical exam, your doctor will examine your burned skin and determine what percentage of your total body surface area is involved. In general, an area of skin roughly equal to the size of your palm equals 1 percent of your total body surface area. For people ages 10 to 40, the American Burn Association defines a severe burn as one that involves 25 percent total body surface area or any burn involving the eyes, ears, face, hands, feet or groin. You'll also be examined for other injuries and to determine whether the burn has affected the rest of your body. You may need lab tests, X-rays or other diagnostic procedures. Treatment Treatment of burns depends on the type and extent of the injuries. Most minor burns can be treated at home using over-the-counter products or aloe. They usually heal within a few weeks. For serious burns, after appropriate first aid care and wound assessment, your treatment may involve medications, wound dressings, therapy and surgery. The goals of treatment are to control pain, remove dead tissue, prevent infection, reduce scarring, regain function and address emotional needs. You may need months of additional treatments and therapy. This may be done during a hospital stay, on an outpatient basis or at home.

Plastic surgery (reconstruction) can improve the appearance of burn scars and increase the flexibility of joints affected by scarring. Lifestyle and home remedies To treat minor burns, follow these steps: - Cool the burn. Run cool (not cold) tap water over the burn for 10 to 15 minutes or until the pain eases. Or apply a clean towel dampened with cool tap water. Don't use ice. Putting ice directly on a burn can cause further damage to the tissue. - Remove rings or other tight items from the burned area. Try to do this quickly and gently, before the area swells. - Don't break small blisters (no bigger than your little fingernail). If blisters break, gently clean the area with mild soap and water, apply an antibiotic ointment, and cover it with a nonstick gauze bandage. - Apply moisturizer or aloe vera lotion or gel. This may soothe the area and prevent dryness as the wound heals. - If needed, take an over-the-counter pain reliever. Nonprescription products include ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, others), naproxen (Aleve) and acetaminophen (Tylenol, others). - Consider a tetanus shot. Make sure that your tetanus booster is up to date. Doctors recommend people get a tetanus shot at least every 10 years. Whether your burn was minor or serious, use sunscreen and moisturizer regularly once the wound is healed. ",

        "article": " Radiation sickness Radiation poisoning Radiation injury Rad poisoning Summary Radiation sickness is illness and symptoms resulting from excessive exposure to ionizing radiation. There are two main types of radiation: nonionizing and ionizing. Nonionizing radiation comes in the form of light, radio waves, microwaves and radar. These forms usually don't cause tissue damage. Ionizing radiation causes immediate effects on human tissue. X-rays, gamma rays, and particle bombardment (neutron beam, electron beam, protons, mesons, and others) give off ionizing radiation. This type of radiation is used for medical testing and treatment. It is also used in industrial and manufacturing purposes, weapons and weapons development, and more. Considerations Radiation sickness results when humans (or other animals) are exposed to very large doses of ionizing radiation. Radiation exposure can occur as a single large exposure (acute). Or it can occur as a series of small exposures spread over time (chronic). Exposure may be accidental or intentional (as in radiation therapy). Radiation sickness is generally associated with acute exposure and has a characteristic set of symptoms that appear in an orderly fashion. Chronic exposure is usually associated with delayed medical problems such as cancer and premature aging, which may happen over a long period of time. The risk of cancer depends on the dose and begins to build up, even with very low doses. There is no \"minimum threshold.\" Exposure from x-rays or gamma rays is measured in units of roentgens. For example: Total body exposure of 100 roentgens/rad or 1 Gray unit (Gy) causes radiation sickness. Total body exposure of 400 roentgens/rad (or 4 Gy) causes radiation sickness and death in half of the individuals who are exposed. Without medical treatment, nearly everyone who receives more than this amount of radiation will die within 30 days. 100,000 roentgens/rad (1,000 Gy) causes almost immediate unconsciousness and death within an hour. The severity of symptoms and illness (acute radiation sickness) depends on the type and amount of radiation, how long you were exposed, and which part of the body was exposed. Symptoms of radiation sickness may occur right after exposure, or over the next few days, weeks, or months. Bone marrow and the gastrointestinal tract are especially sensitive to radiation injury. Children and babies still in the womb are more likely to be severely injured by radiation. Because it is difficult to determine the amount of radiation exposure from nuclear accidents, the best signs of the severity of the exposure are: the length of time between the exposure and the onset of symptoms, the severity of symptoms, and severity of changes in white blood cells. If a person vomits less than an hour after being exposed, that usually means the radiation dose received is very high and death may be expected. Children who receive radiation treatments or who are accidentally exposed to radiation will be treated based on their symptoms and their blood cell counts. Frequent blood studies are necessary and require a small puncture through the skin into a vein to obtain blood samples. Causes Causes include: Accidental exposure to high doses of radiation, such as radiation from a nuclear power plant accident. Exposure to excessive radiation for medical treatments. Symptoms Symptoms of radiation sickness may include: Weakness, fatigue, fainting, confusion Bleeding from the nose, mouth, gums, and rectum Bruising, skin burns, open sores on the skin, sloughing of skin Dehydration Diarrhea, bloody stool Fever Hair loss Inflammation of exposed areas (redness, tenderness, swelling, bleeding) Nausea and vomiting, including vomiting of blood Ulcers (sores) in the mouth, esophagus (food pipe), stomach or intestines Your health care provider will advise you how best to treat these symptoms. Medicines may be prescribed to help reduce nausea, vomiting, and pain. Blood transfusions may be given for anemia (low counts of healthy red blood cells). Antibiotics are used to prevent or fight infections. First Aid Giving first aid to radiation victims may expose rescue personnel to radiation unless they are properly protected. Victims must be decontaminated so that they do not cause radiation injury to others. Check the person's breathing and pulse. Start CPR, if necessary. Remove the person's clothing and place the items in a sealed container. This stops ongoing contamination. Vigorously wash the victim with soap and water. Dry the victim and wrap with a soft, clean blanket. Call for emergency medical help or take the person to nearest emergency medical facility if you can do so safely. Report the exposure to emergency officials. If symptoms occur during or after medical radiation treatments: Tell the provider or seek medical treatment right away. Handle affected areas gently. Treat symptoms or illnesses as recommended by the provider. DO NOT DO NOT remain in the area where exposure occurred. DO NOT apply ointments to burned areas. DO NOT remain in contaminated clothing. DO NOT hesitate to seek emergency medical treatment. Prevention Preventive measures include: Avoid unnecessary exposure to radiation, including unnecessary CT scans and x-rays. People working in radiation hazard areas should wear badges to measure their exposure level. Protective shields should always be placed over the parts of the body not being treated or studied during x-ray imaging tests or radiation therapy.

    "question": "what are the causes of pulmonary hypertension",
    "multi_abs_summ": "When blood passes through the heart, the lower right chamber pumps blood to your lungs through the pulmonary artery. From your lungs the blood flows to the left side of the heart. With pulmonary hypertension, the cells that line your pulmonary arteries become stiff and thick, making it harder for blood to flow. This raises the blood pressure in the pulmonary arteries. Your risk of developing pulmonary hypertension may be greater for a few reasons. These include if you're a young adult, you're overweight, you have a family history of the disease, you use illegal drugs, you take certain appetite-suppressant medications, you have an existing risk of developing pulmonary hypertension, or you live at a high altitude. The World Health Organization divides pulmonary hypertension (PH) into five groups. These groups are organized based on the cause of the condition.",

Other symptoms include: Ankle and leg swelling Bluish color of the lips or skin (cyanosis) Chest pain or pressure, usually in the front of the chest Dizziness or fainting spells Fatigue Increased abdomen size Weakness People with pulmonary hypertension often have symptoms that come and go. They report good days and bad days. Exams and Tests Your health care provider will perform a physical exam and ask about your symptoms. The exam may find: Abnormal heart sounds Feeling of a pulse over the breastbone Heart murmur on the right side of the heart Larger-than-normal veins in the neck Leg swelling Liver and spleen swelling Normal breath sounds if pulmonary hypertension is idiopathic or due to congenital heart disease Abnormal breath sounds if pulmonary hypertension is from other lung disease In the early stages of the disease, the exam may be normal or almost normal. The condition may take several months to diagnose. Asthma and other diseases may cause similar symptoms and must be ruled out. Tests that may be ordered include: Blood tests Cardiac catheterization Chest x-ray CT scan of the chest Echocardiogram ECG Lung function tests Nuclear lung scan Pulmonary arteriogram 6-minute walk test Sleep study Tests to check for autoimmune problems Treatment There is no cure for pulmonary hypertension. The goal of treatment is to control symptoms and prevent more lung damage. It is important to treat medical disorders that cause pulmonary hypertension, such as obstructive sleep apnea, lung conditions, and heart valve problems. Many treatment options for pulmonary arterial hypertension are available. If you are prescribed medicines, they may be taken by mouth (oral), received through the vein (intravenous, or IV), or breathed in (inhaled). Your provider will decide which medicine is best for you. You will be closely monitored during treatment to watch for side effects and to see how well you are responding to the medicine. DO NOT stop taking your medicines without talking to your provider. Other treatments may include: Blood thinners to reduce the risk of blood clots, especially if you have IPAH Oxygen therapy at home Lung, or in some cases, heart-lung transplant, if medicines do not work Other important tips to follow: Avoid pregnancy Avoid heavy physical activities and lifting Avoid traveling to high altitudes Get a yearly flu vaccine, as well as other vaccines such as the pneumonia vaccine Stop smoking Outlook (Prognosis) How well you do depends on what caused the condition. Medicines for IPAH may help slow the disease. As the illness gets worse, you will need to make changes in your home to help you get around the house.

        "article": " Pulmonary hypertension Pulmonary arterial hypertension Sporadic primary pulmonary hypertension Familial primary pulmonary hypertension Idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension Primary pulmonary hypertension PPH Secondary pulmonary hypertension Cor pulmonale - pulmonary hypertension Summary Pulmonary hypertension is high blood pressure in the arteries of the lungs. It makes the right side of the heart work harder than normal. Causes The right side of the heart pumps blood through the lungs, where it picks up oxygen. Blood returns to the left side of the heart, where it is pumped to the rest of the body. When the small arteries (blood vessels) of the lungs become narrowed, they cannot carry as much blood. When this happens, pressure builds up. This is called pulmonary hypertension. The heart needs to work harder to force the blood through the vessels against this pressure. Over time, this causes the right side of the heart to become larger. This condition is called right-sided heart failure, or cor pulmonale. Pulmonary hypertension may be caused by: Autoimmune diseases that damage the lungs, such as scleroderma and rheumatoid arthritis Birth defects of the heart Blood clots in the lung (pulmonary embolism) Heart failure Heart valve disease HIV infection Low oxygen levels in the blood for a long time (chronic) Lung disease, such as COPD or pulmonary fibrosis or any other severe chronic lung condition Medicines (for example, certain diet drugs) Obstructive sleep apnea In rare cases, the cause of pulmonary hypertension is unknown. In this case, the condition is called idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension (IPAH). Idiopathic means the cause of a disease is not known. IPAH affects more women than men. If pulmonary hypertension is caused by a known medicine or medical condition, it is called secondary pulmonary hypertension. Symptoms Shortness of breath or lightheadedness during activity is often the first symptom. Fast heart rate (palpitations) may be present. Over time, symptoms occur with lighter activity or even while at rest. Other symptoms include: Ankle and leg swelling Bluish color of the lips or skin (cyanosis) Chest pain or pressure, usually in the front of the chest Dizziness or fainting spells Fatigue Increased abdomen size Weakness People with pulmonary hypertension often have symptoms that come and go. They report good days and bad days. Exams and Tests Your health care provider will perform a physical exam and ask about your symptoms. The exam may find: Abnormal heart sounds Feeling of a pulse over the breastbone Heart murmur on the right side of the heart Larger-than-normal veins in the neck Leg swelling Liver and spleen swelling Normal breath sounds if pulmonary hypertension is idiopathic or due to congenital heart disease Abnormal breath sounds if pulmonary hypertension is from other lung disease In the early stages of the disease, the exam may be normal or almost normal. The condition may take several months to diagnose. Asthma and other diseases may cause similar symptoms and must be ruled out. Tests that may be ordered include: Blood tests Cardiac catheterization Chest x-ray CT scan of the chest Echocardiogram ECG Lung function tests Nuclear lung scan Pulmonary arteriogram 6-minute walk test Sleep study Tests to check for autoimmune problems Treatment There is no cure for pulmonary hypertension. The goal of treatment is to control symptoms and prevent more lung damage. It is important to treat medical disorders that cause pulmonary hypertension, such as obstructive sleep apnea, lung conditions, and heart valve problems. Many treatment options for pulmonary arterial hypertension are available. If you are prescribed medicines, they may be taken by mouth (oral), received through the vein (intravenous, or IV), or breathed in (inhaled). Your provider will decide which medicine is best for you. You will be closely monitored during treatment to watch for side effects and to see how well you are responding to the medicine. DO NOT stop taking your medicines without talking to your provider. Other treatments may include: Blood thinners to reduce the risk of blood clots, especially if you have IPAH Oxygen therapy at home Lung, or in some cases, heart-lung transplant, if medicines do not work Other important tips to follow: Avoid pregnancy Avoid heavy physical activities and lifting Avoid traveling to high altitudes Get a yearly flu vaccine, as well as other vaccines such as the pneumonia vaccine Stop smoking Outlook (Prognosis) How well you do depends on what caused the condition. Medicines for IPAH may help slow the disease. As the illness gets worse, you will need to make changes in your home to help you get around the house. When to Contact a Medical Professional Call your provider if: You begin to develop shortness of breath when you are active Shortness of breath gets worse You develop chest pain You develop other symptoms Review Date 2/18/2018 Updated by: Denis Hadjiliadis, MD, MHS, Paul F.

        "article": " Pulmonary hypertension Overview Pulmonary hypertension is a type of high blood pressure that affects the arteries in your lungs and the right side of your heart. In one form of pulmonary hypertension, tiny arteries in your lungs, called pulmonary arterioles, and capillaries become narrowed, blocked or destroyed. This makes it harder for blood to flow through your lungs, and raises pressure within your lungs' arteries. As the pressure builds, your heart's lower right chamber (right ventricle) must work harder to pump blood through your lungs, eventually causing your heart muscle to weaken and fail.

Although some forms of pulmonary hypertension aren't curable, treatment can help lessen symptoms and improve your quality of life. Symptoms The signs and symptoms of pulmonary hypertension in its early stages might not be noticeable for months or even years. As the disease progresses, symptoms become worse. Pulmonary hypertension symptoms include: - Shortness of breath (dyspnea), initially while exercising and eventually while at rest - Fatigue - Dizziness or fainting spells (syncope) - Chest pressure or pain - Swelling (edema) in your ankles, legs and eventually in your abdomen (ascites) - Bluish color to your lips and skin (cyanosis) - Racing pulse or heart palpitations Causes Your heart has two upper chambers (atria) and two lower chambers (ventricles).

The blood then returns to your lungs instead of going to the rest of your body, increasing the pressure in the pulmonary arteries and causing pulmonary hypertension. Risk factors Your risk of developing pulmonary hypertension may be greater if: - You're a young adult, as idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension is more common in younger adults - You're overweight - You have a family history of the disease - You have one of various conditions that can increase your risk of developing pulmonary hypertension - You use illegal drugs, such as cocaine - You take certain appetite-suppressant medications - You have an existing risk of developing pulmonary hypertension, such as a family history of the condition, and you live at a high altitude Diagnosis Pulmonary hypertension is hard to diagnose early because it's not often detected in a routine physical exam. Even when the condition is more advanced, its signs and symptoms are similar to those of other heart and lung conditions. To diagnose your condition, your doctor may review your medical and family history, discuss your signs and symptoms, and conduct a physical examination. Doctors may order several tests to diagnose pulmonary hypertension, determine the severity of your condition and find out the cause of your condition. Tests may include: - Echocardiogram. Sound waves can create moving images of the beating heart. An echocardiogram can help your doctor to check the size and functioning of the right ventricle, and the thickness of the right ventricle's wall. An echocardiogram can also show how well your heart chambers and valves are working. Doctors may also use this to measure the pressure in your pulmonary arteries. In some cases, your doctor will recommend an exercise echocardiogram to help determine how well your heart and lungs work under stress. In this test, you'll have an echocardiogram before exercising on a stationary bike or treadmill and another test immediately afterward. This could be done as an oxygen consumption test, in which you may have to wear a mask that assesses the ability of your heart and lungs to deal with oxygen and carbon dioxide. Other exercise tests may also be done. These tests can help determine the severity and cause of your condition. They may also be done at follow-up appointments to check that your treatments are working. - Chest X-ray. A chest X-ray can show images of your heart, lungs and chest. This test can show enlargement of the right ventricle of the heart or the pulmonary arteries, which can occur in pulmonary hypertension. This test can also be used to identify other conditions that may be causing pulmonary hypertension. - Electrocardiogram (ECG). This noninvasive test shows your heart's electrical patterns and can detect abnormal rhythms. Doctors may also be able to see signs of right ventricle enlargement or strain. - Right heart catheterization. After you've had an echocardiogram, if your doctor thinks you have pulmonary hypertension, you'll likely have a right heart catheterization. This test can often help confirm that you have pulmonary hypertension and determine the severity of your condition. During the procedure, a cardiologist places a thin, flexible tube (catheter) into a vein in your neck or groin. The catheter is then threaded into your right ventricle and pulmonary artery. Right heart catheterization allows your doctor to directly measure the pressure in the main pulmonary arteries and right ventricle. It's also used to see what effect different medications may have on your pulmonary hypertension. - Blood tests. Your doctor might order blood tests to check for certain substances in your blood that might show you have pulmonary hypertension or its complications. Blood tests can also test for certain conditions that may be causing your condition. Your doctor might order additional tests to check the condition of your lungs and pulmonary arteries and to determine the cause of your condition, including: - Computerized tomography (CT) scan. During a CT scan, you lie on a table inside a doughnut-shaped machine. CT scanning generates X-rays to produce cross-sectional images of your body. Doctors may inject a dye into your blood vessels that helps your arteries to be more visible on the CT pictures (CT angiography). Doctors may use this test to look at the heart's size and function and to check for blood clots in the lungs' arteries. - Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). This test may be used to check the right ventricle's function and the blood flow in the lung's arteries. In this test, you lie on a movable table that slides into the tunnel. An MRI uses a magnetic field and pulses of radio wave energy to make pictures of the body. - Pulmonary function test. This noninvasive test measures how much air your lungs can hold, and the airflow in and out of your lungs. During the test, you'll blow into a simple instrument called a spirometer. - Polysomnogram. This test detects your brain activity, heart rate, blood pressure, oxygen levels and other factors while you sleep. It can help diagnose a sleep disorder such as obstructive sleep apnea. - Ventilation/perfusion (V/Q) scan. In this test, a tracer is injected into a vein in your arm. The tracer maps blood flow and air to your lungs. This test can be used to determine whether blood clots are causing symptoms of pulmonary hypertension. - Open-lung biopsy. Rarely, a doctor might recommend an open-lung biopsy. An open-lung biopsy is a type of surgery in which a small sample of tissue is removed from your lungs under general anesthesia to check for a possible secondary cause of pulmonary hypertension. Genetic tests If a family member has had pulmonary hypertension, your doctor might screen you for genes that are linked with pulmonary hypertension. If you test positive, your doctor might recommend that other family members be screened for the same genetic mutation. Pulmonary hypertension classifications Once you've been diagnosed with pulmonary hypertension, your doctor might classify the severity of your disease into one of several classes, including: - Class I. Although you've been diagnosed with pulmonary hypertension, you have no symptoms with normal activity. - Class II. You don't have symptoms at rest, but you experience symptoms such as fatigue, shortness of breath or chest pain with normal activity. - Class III. You're comfortable at rest, but have symptoms when you're physically active. - Class IV. You have symptoms with physical activity and while at rest. Treatment Pulmonary hypertension can't be cured, but doctors can help you manage your condition. Treatment may help improve your symptoms and slow the progress of pulmonary hypertension. It often takes some time to find the most appropriate treatment for pulmonary hypertension. The treatments are often complex and require extensive follow-up care. Your doctor might also need to change your treatment if it's no longer effective. When pulmonary hypertension is caused by another condition, your doctor will treat the underlying cause whenever possible. Medications - Blood vessel dilators (vasodilators). Vasodilators open narrowed blood vessels. One of the most commonly prescribed vasodilators for pulmonary hypertension is epoprostenol (Flolan, Veletri). The drawback to epoprostenol is that its effects last only a few minutes. This drug is continuously injected through an intravenous (IV) catheter via a small pump that you wear in a pack on your belt or shoulder. Potential side effects of epoprostenol include jaw pain, nausea, diarrhea and leg cramps, as well as pain and infection at the IV site. Another form of the drug, iloprost (Ventavis), can be inhaled six to nine times a day through a nebulizer, a machine that vaporizes your medication. Because it's inhaled, it goes directly to the lungs. Side effects associated with iloprost include chest pain - often accompanied by a headache and nausea - and breathlessness. Treprostinil (Tyvaso, Remodulin, Orenitram), another form of the drug, can be given four times a day. It can be inhaled, taken as oral medication or administered by injection. It can cause side effects such as a headache, nausea and diarrhea. - Endothelin receptor antagonists. These medications reverse the effect of endothelin, a substance in the walls of blood vessels that causes them to narrow. These drugs may improve your energy level and symptoms. However, these drugs shouldn't be taken if you're pregnant. Also, these drugs can damage your liver and you may need monthly liver monitoring. These medications include bosentan (Tracleer), macitentan (Opsumit), and ambrisentan (Letairis). - Sildenafil and tadalafil. Sildenafil (Revatio, Viagra) and tadalafil (Cialis, Adcirca) are sometimes used to treat pulmonary hypertension. These drugs work by opening the blood vessels in the lungs to allow blood to flow through more easily. Side effects can include an upset stomach, headache and vision problems. - High-dose calcium channel blockers. These drugs help relax the muscles in the walls of your blood vessels. They include medications such as amlodipine (Norvasc), diltiazem (Cardizem, Tiazac, others) and nifedipine (Procardia, others). Although calcium channel blockers can be effective, only a small number of people with pulmonary hypertension respond to them. - Soluble guanylate cyclase (SGC) stimulator. Soluble guanylate cyclase (SGC) stimulators (Adempas) interact with nitric oxide and help relax the pulmonary arteries and lower the pressure within the arteries. These medications should not be taken if you're pregnant. They can sometimes cause dizziness or nausea. - Anticoagulants. Your doctor is likely to prescribe the anticoagulant warfarin (Coumadin, Jantoven) to help prevent the formation of blood clots within the small pulmonary arteries. Because anticoagulants prevent normal blood coagulation, they increase your risk of bleeding complications. Take warfarin exactly as prescribed, because warfarin can cause severe side effects if taken incorrectly. If you're taking warfarin, your doctor will ask you to have periodic blood tests to check how well the drug is working. Many other drugs, herbal supplements and foods can interact with warfarin, so be sure your doctor knows all of the medications you're taking. - Digoxin. Digoxin (Lanoxin) can help the heart beat stronger and pump more blood. It can help control the heart rate if you experience arrhythmias. - Diuretics. Commonly known as water pills, these medications help eliminate excess fluid from your body. This reduces the amount of work your heart has to do. They may also be used to limit fluid buildup in your lungs. - Oxygen. Your doctor might suggest that you sometimes breathe pure oxygen, a treatment known as oxygen therapy, to help treat pulmonary hypertension, especially if you live at a high altitude or have sleep apnea. Some people who have pulmonary hypertension eventually require continuous oxygen therapy. Surgeries - Atrial septostomy. If medications don't control your pulmonary hypertension, this open-heart surgery might be an option. In an atrial septostomy, a surgeon will create an opening between the upper left and right chambers of your heart (atria) to relieve the pressure on the right side of your heart. Atrial septostomy can have serious complications, including heart rhythm abnormalities (arrhythmias). - Transplantation. In some cases, a lung or heart-lung transplant might be an option, especially for younger people who have idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension. Major risks of any type of transplantation include rejection of the transplanted organ and serious infection, and you must take immunosuppressant drugs for life to help reduce the chance of rejection. Lifestyle and home remedies Although medical treatment can't cure pulmonary hypertension, it can lessen symptoms. Lifestyle changes also can help improve your condition. Consider these tips: - Get plenty of rest. Resting can reduce the fatigue that might come from having pulmonary hypertension. - Stay as active as possible. Even the mildest forms of activity might be too exhausting for some people who have pulmonary hypertension. For others, moderate exercise such as walking might be beneficial - especially when done with oxygen. But first, talk to your doctor about specific exercise restrictions. In most cases, it's recommended that you not lift heavy weights. Your doctor can help you plan an appropriate exercise program. - Don't smoke. If you smoke, the most important thing you can do for your heart and lungs is to stop. If you can't stop smoking by yourself, ask your doctor to prescribe a treatment plan to help you quit. Also, avoid secondhand smoke if possible. - Avoid pregnancy and birth control pills. If you're a woman of childbearing age, avoid pregnancy. Pregnancy can be life-threatening for both you and your baby. Also avoid using birth control pills, which can increase your risk of blood clots. Talk to your doctor about alternative forms of birth control. If you do become pregnant, it's important to consult with your doctor as pulmonary hypertension can cause serious complications to both you and the fetus. - Avoid traveling to or living at high altitudes. High altitudes can worsen the symptoms of pulmonary hypertension. If you live at an altitude of 8,000 feet (2,438 meters) or higher, your doctor might recommend that you move to a lower altitude. - Avoid situations that can excessively lower blood pressure. These include sitting in a hot tub or sauna or taking long hot baths or showers. These activities lower your blood pressure and can cause fainting or even death. Also avoid activities that cause prolonged straining, such as lifting heavy objects or weights. - Follow a nutritious diet and stay at a healthy weight. Aim to eat a healthy diet of whole grains, a variety of fruits and vegetables, lean meats and low-fat dairy products. Avoid saturated fat, trans fat and cholesterol. It's likely your doctor will recommend limiting the amount of salt in your diet. Aim to maintain a healthy weight. - Ask your doctor about medications. Take all your medications as prescribed. Ask your doctor about any other medications before taking them, as some can interfere with your medication or worsen your condition. - See your doctor at follow-up appointments. Your doctor may recommend regular follow-up appointments. Let your doctor know if you have any questions about your condition or medications you're taking, or if you have any symptoms or side effects from your medications. If pulmonary hypertension is affecting your quality of life, ask your doctor about options that could improve your quality of life. - Get vaccines. Your doctor may recommend getting an influenza and pneumonia vaccine, as these conditions can cause serious issues for people with pulmonary hypertension. - Get support. If you're feeling stressed or worried due to your condition, get support from family or friends. Or, consider joining a support group with others who have pulmonary hypertension. ",

They may also be done at follow-up appointments to check that your treatments are working. - Chest X-ray. A chest X-ray can show images of your heart, lungs and chest. This test can show enlargement of the right ventricle of the heart or the pulmonary arteries, which can occur in pulmonary hypertension. This test can also be used to identify other conditions that may be causing pulmonary hypertension. - Electrocardiogram (ECG). This noninvasive test shows your heart's electrical patterns and can detect abnormal rhythms. Doctors may also be able to see signs of right ventricle enlargement or strain. - Right heart catheterization. After you've had an echocardiogram, if your doctor thinks you have pulmonary hypertension, you'll likely have a right heart catheterization. This test can often help confirm that you have pulmonary hypertension and determine the severity of your condition. During the procedure, a cardiologist places a thin, flexible tube (catheter) into a vein in your neck or groin. The catheter is then threaded into your right ventricle and pulmonary artery. Right heart catheterization allows your doctor to directly measure the pressure in the main pulmonary arteries and right ventricle. It's also used to see what effect different medications may have on your pulmonary hypertension. - Blood tests. Your doctor might order blood tests to check for certain substances in your blood that might show you have pulmonary hypertension or its complications. Blood tests can also test for certain conditions that may be causing your condition. Your doctor might order additional tests to check the condition of your lungs and pulmonary arteries and to determine the cause of your condition, including: - Computerized tomography (CT) scan. During a CT scan, you lie on a table inside a doughnut-shaped machine. CT scanning generates X-rays to produce cross-sectional images of your body. Doctors may inject a dye into your blood vessels that helps your arteries to be more visible on the CT pictures (CT angiography). Doctors may use this test to look at the heart's size and function and to check for blood clots in the lungs' arteries. - Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). This test may be used to check the right ventricle's function and the blood flow in the lung's arteries. In this test, you lie on a movable table that slides into the tunnel. An MRI uses a magnetic field and pulses of radio wave energy to make pictures of the body. - Pulmonary function test. This noninvasive test measures how much air your lungs can hold, and the airflow in and out of your lungs. During the test, you'll blow into a simple instrument called a spirometer. - Polysomnogram. This test detects your brain activity, heart rate, blood pressure, oxygen levels and other factors while you sleep. It can help diagnose a sleep disorder such as obstructive sleep apnea. - Ventilation/perfusion (V/Q) scan. In this test, a tracer is injected into a vein in your arm. The tracer maps blood flow and air to your lungs. This test can be used to determine whether blood clots are causing symptoms of pulmonary hypertension. - Open-lung biopsy. Rarely, a doctor might recommend an open-lung biopsy. An open-lung biopsy is a type of surgery in which a small sample of tissue is removed from your lungs under general anesthesia to check for a possible secondary cause of pulmonary hypertension. Genetic tests If a family member has had pulmonary hypertension, your doctor might screen you for genes that are linked with pulmonary hypertension. If you test positive, your doctor might recommend that other family members be screened for the same genetic mutation. Pulmonary hypertension classifications Once you've been diagnosed with pulmonary hypertension, your doctor might classify the severity of your disease into one of several classes, including: - Class I. Although you've been diagnosed with pulmonary hypertension, you have no symptoms with normal activity. - Class II. You don't have symptoms at rest, but you experience symptoms such as fatigue, shortness of breath or chest pain with normal activity. - Class III. You're comfortable at rest, but have symptoms when you're physically active. - Class IV. You have symptoms with physical activity and while at rest. Pulmonary hypertension can't be cured, but doctors can help you manage your condition. Treatment may help improve your symptoms and slow the progress of pulmonary hypertension. It often takes some time to find the most appropriate treatment for pulmonary hypertension. The treatments are often complex and require extensive follow-up care. Your doctor might also need to change your treatment if it's no longer effective. When pulmonary hypertension is caused by another condition, your doctor will treat the underlying cause whenever possible. Medications - Blood vessel dilators (vasodilators). Vasodilators open narrowed blood vessels. One of the most commonly prescribed vasodilators for pulmonary hypertension is epoprostenol (Flolan, Veletri). The drawback to epoprostenol is that its effects last only a few minutes. This drug is continuously injected through an intravenous (IV) catheter via a small pump that you wear in a pack on your belt or shoulder. Potential side effects of epoprostenol include jaw pain, nausea, diarrhea and leg cramps, as well as pain and infection at the IV site. Another form of the drug, iloprost (Ventavis), can be inhaled six to nine times a day through a nebulizer, a machine that vaporizes your medication. Because it's inhaled, it goes directly to the lungs. Side effects associated with iloprost include chest pain - often accompanied by a headache and nausea - and breathlessness. Treprostinil (Tyvaso, Remodulin, Orenitram), another form of the drug, can be given four times a day. It can be inhaled, taken as oral medication or administered by injection. It can cause side effects such as a headache, nausea and diarrhea. - Endothelin receptor antagonists. These medications reverse the effect of endothelin, a substance in the walls of blood vessels that causes them to narrow. These drugs may improve your energy level and symptoms. However, these drugs shouldn't be taken if you're pregnant. Also, these drugs can damage your liver and you may need monthly liver monitoring. These medications include bosentan (Tracleer), macitentan (Opsumit), and ambrisentan (Letairis). - Sildenafil and tadalafil. Sildenafil (Revatio, Viagra) and tadalafil (Cialis, Adcirca) are sometimes used to treat pulmonary hypertension. These drugs work by opening the blood vessels in the lungs to allow blood to flow through more easily. Side effects can include an upset stomach, headache and vision problems. - High-dose calcium channel blockers. These drugs help relax the muscles in the walls of your blood vessels. They include medications such as amlodipine (Norvasc), diltiazem (Cardizem, Tiazac, others) and nifedipine (Procardia, others). Although calcium channel blockers can be effective, only a small number of people with pulmonary hypertension respond to them. - Soluble guanylate cyclase (SGC) stimulator. Soluble guanylate cyclase (SGC) stimulators (Adempas) interact with nitric oxide and help relax the pulmonary arteries and lower the pressure within the arteries. These medications should not be taken if you're pregnant. They can sometimes cause dizziness or nausea. - Anticoagulants. Your doctor is likely to prescribe the anticoagulant warfarin (Coumadin, Jantoven) to help prevent the formation of blood clots within the small pulmonary arteries. Because anticoagulants prevent normal blood coagulation, they increase your risk of bleeding complications. Take warfarin exactly as prescribed, because warfarin can cause severe side effects if taken incorrectly. If you're taking warfarin, your doctor will ask you to have periodic blood tests to check how well the drug is working. Many other drugs, herbal supplements and foods can interact with warfarin, so be sure your doctor knows all of the medications you're taking. - Digoxin. Digoxin (Lanoxin) can help the heart beat stronger and pump more blood. It can help control the heart rate if you experience arrhythmias. - Diuretics. Commonly known as water pills, these medications help eliminate excess fluid from your body. This reduces the amount of work your heart has to do. They may also be used to limit fluid buildup in your lungs. - Oxygen. Your doctor might suggest that you sometimes breathe pure oxygen, a treatment known as oxygen therapy, to help treat pulmonary hypertension, especially if you live at a high altitude or have sleep apnea. Some people who have pulmonary hypertension eventually require continuous oxygen therapy. Surgeries - Atrial septostomy. If medications don't control your pulmonary hypertension, this open-heart surgery might be an option. In an atrial septostomy, a surgeon will create an opening between the upper left and right chambers of your heart (atria) to relieve the pressure on the right side of your heart. Atrial septostomy can have serious complications, including heart rhythm abnormalities (arrhythmias). - Transplantation. In some cases, a lung or heart-lung transplant might be an option, especially for younger people who have idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension. Major risks of any type of transplantation include rejection of the transplanted organ and serious infection, and you must take immunosuppressant drugs for life to help reduce the chance of rejection. Although medical treatment can't cure pulmonary hypertension, it can lessen symptoms. Lifestyle changes also can help improve your condition. Consider these tips: - Get plenty of rest. Resting can reduce the fatigue that might come from having pulmonary hypertension. - Stay as active as possible. Even the mildest forms of activity might be too exhausting for some people who have pulmonary hypertension. For others, moderate exercise such as walking might be beneficial - especially when done with oxygen. But first, talk to your doctor about specific exercise restrictions. In most cases, it's recommended that you not lift heavy weights. Your doctor can help you plan an appropriate exercise program. - Don't smoke. If you smoke, the most important thing you can do for your heart and lungs is to stop. If you can't stop smoking by yourself, ask your doctor to prescribe a treatment plan to help you quit. Also, avoid secondhand smoke if possible. - Avoid pregnancy and birth control pills. If you're a woman of childbearing age, avoid pregnancy. Pregnancy can be life-threatening for both you and your baby. Also avoid using birth control pills, which can increase your risk of blood clots. Talk to your doctor about alternative forms of birth control. If you do become pregnant, it's important to consult with your doctor as pulmonary hypertension can cause serious complications to both you and the fetus. - Avoid traveling to or living at high altitudes. High altitudes can worsen the symptoms of pulmonary hypertension. If you live at an altitude of 8,000 feet (2,438 meters) or higher, your doctor might recommend that you move to a lower altitude. - Avoid situations that can excessively lower blood pressure. These include sitting in a hot tub or sauna or taking long hot baths or showers. These activities lower your blood pressure and can cause fainting or even death. Also avoid activities that cause prolonged straining, such as lifting heavy objects or weights. - Follow a nutritious diet and stay at a healthy weight. Aim to eat a healthy diet of whole grains, a variety of fruits and vegetables, lean meats and low-fat dairy products. Avoid saturated fat, trans fat and cholesterol. It's likely your doctor will recommend limiting the amount of salt in your diet. Aim to maintain a healthy weight. - Ask your doctor about medications. Take all your medications as prescribed. Ask your doctor about any other medications before taking them, as some can interfere with your medication or worsen your condition. - See your doctor at follow-up appointments. Your doctor may recommend regular follow-up appointments. Let your doctor know if you have any questions about your condition or medications you're taking, or if you have any symptoms or side effects from your medications. If pulmonary hypertension is affecting your quality of life, ask your doctor about options that could improve your quality of life. - Get vaccines. Your doctor may recommend getting an influenza and pneumonia vaccine, as these conditions can cause serious issues for people with pulmonary hypertension. - Get support. If you're feeling stressed or worried due to your condition, get support from family or friends. Or, consider joining a support group with others who have pulmonary hypertension.",
        "article": " Pulmonary hypertension Overview Pulmonary hypertension is a type of high blood pressure that affects the arteries in your lungs and the right side of your heart. In one form of pulmonary hypertension, tiny arteries in your lungs, called pulmonary arterioles, and capillaries become narrowed, blocked or destroyed. This makes it harder for blood to flow through your lungs, and raises pressure within your lungs' arteries. As the pressure builds, your heart's lower right chamber (right ventricle) must work harder to pump blood through your lungs, eventually causing your heart muscle to weaken and fail. Some forms of pulmonary hypertension are serious conditions that become progressively worse and are sometimes fatal. Although some forms of pulmonary hypertension aren't curable, treatment can help lessen symptoms and improve your quality of life. Symptoms The signs and symptoms of pulmonary hypertension in its early stages might not be noticeable for months or even years. As the disease progresses, symptoms become worse. Pulmonary hypertension symptoms include: - Shortness of breath (dyspnea), initially while exercising and eventually while at rest - Fatigue - Dizziness or fainting spells (syncope) - Chest pressure or pain - Swelling (edema) in your ankles, legs and eventually in your abdomen (ascites) - Bluish color to your lips and skin (cyanosis) - Racing pulse or heart palpitations Causes Your heart has two upper chambers (atria) and two lower chambers (ventricles). Each time blood passes through your heart, the lower right chamber (right ventricle) pumps blood to your lungs through a large blood vessel (pulmonary artery). In your lungs, the blood releases carbon dioxide and picks up oxygen. The oxygen-rich blood then flows through blood vessels in your lungs (pulmonary arteries, capillaries and veins) to the left side of your heart. Ordinarily, the blood flows easily through the vessels in your lungs, so blood pressure is usually much lower in your lungs. With pulmonary hypertension, the rise in blood pressure is caused by changes in the cells that line your pulmonary arteries. These changes can cause the walls of the arteries to become stiff and thick, and extra tissue may form. The blood vessels may also become inflamed and tight. These changes in the pulmonary arteries can reduce or block blood flow through the blood vessels. This makes it harder for blood to flow, raising the blood pressure in the pulmonary arteries. Pulmonary hypertension is classified into five groups, depending on the cause. Group 1: Pulmonary arterial hypertension - Cause unknown, known as idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension - A specific gene mutation that can cause pulmonary hypertension to develop in families, also called heritable pulmonary arterial hypertension - Certain drugs - such as certain prescription diet drugs or illegal drugs such as methamphetamines - or certain toxins - Heart abnormalities present at birth (congenital heart disease) - Other conditions, such as connective tissue disorders (scleroderma, lupus, others), HIV infection or chronic liver disease (cirrhosis) Group 2: Pulmonary hypertension caused by left-sided heart disease - Left-sided valvular heart disease, such as mitral valve or aortic valve disease - Failure of the lower left heart chamber (left ventricle) Group 3: Pulmonary hypertension caused by lung disease - Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, such as emphysema - Lung disease such as pulmonary fibrosis, a condition that causes scarring in the tissue between the lungs' air sacs (interstitium) - Sleep apnea and other sleep disorders - Long-term exposure to high altitudes in people who may be at higher risk of pulmonary hypertension Group 4: Pulmonary hypertension caused by chronic blood clots - Chronic blood clots in the lungs (pulmonary emboli) Group 5: Pulmonary hypertension associated with other conditions that have unclear reasons why the pulmonary hypertension occurs - Blood disorders - Disorders that affect several organs in the body, such as sarcoidosis - Metabolic disorders, such as glycogen storage disease - Tumors pressing against pulmonary arteries Eisenmenger syndrome and pulmonary hypertension Eisenmenger syndrome, a type of congenital heart disease, causes pulmonary hypertension. It's most commonly caused by a large hole in your heart between the two lower heart chambers (ventricles), called a ventricular septal defect. This hole in your heart causes blood to circulate abnormally in your heart. Oxygen-carrying blood (red blood) mixes with oxygen-poor blood (blue blood). The blood then returns to your lungs instead of going to the rest of your body, increasing the pressure in the pulmonary arteries and causing pulmonary hypertension. Risk factors Your risk of developing pulmonary hypertension may be greater if: - You're a young adult, as idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension is more common in younger adults - You're overweight - You have a family history of the disease - You have one of various conditions that can increase your risk of developing pulmonary hypertension - You use illegal drugs, such as cocaine - You take certain appetite-suppressant medications - You have an existing risk of developing pulmonary hypertension, such as a family history of the condition, and you live at a high altitude Diagnosis Pulmonary hypertension is hard to diagnose early because it's not often detected in a routine physical exam. Even when the condition is more advanced, its signs and symptoms are similar to those of other heart and lung conditions. To diagnose your condition, your doctor may review your medical and family history, discuss your signs and symptoms, and conduct a physical examination. Doctors may order several tests to diagnose pulmonary hypertension, determine the severity of your condition and find out the cause of your condition. Tests may include: - Echocardiogram. Sound waves can create moving images of the beating heart. An echocardiogram can help your doctor to check the size and functioning of the right ventricle, and the thickness of the right ventricle's wall. An echocardiogram can also show how well your heart chambers and valves are working. Doctors may also use this to measure the pressure in your pulmonary arteries. In some cases, your doctor will recommend an exercise echocardiogram to help determine how well your heart and lungs work under stress. In this test, you'll have an echocardiogram before exercising on a stationary bike or treadmill and another test immediately afterward. This could be done as an oxygen consumption test, in which you may have to wear a mask that assesses the ability of your heart and lungs to deal with oxygen and carbon dioxide. Other exercise tests may also be done. These tests can help determine the severity and cause of your condition. They may also be done at follow-up appointments to check that your treatments are working. - Chest X-ray. A chest X-ray can show images of your heart, lungs and chest.

It's most commonly caused by a large hole in your heart between the two lower heart chambers (ventricles), called a ventricular septal defect. This hole in your heart causes blood to circulate abnormally in your heart. Oxygen-carrying blood (red blood) mixes with oxygen-poor blood (blue blood). The blood then returns to your lungs instead of going to the rest of your body, increasing the pressure in the pulmonary arteries and causing pulmonary hypertension. Risk factors Your risk of developing pulmonary hypertension may be greater if: - You're a young adult, as idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension is more common in younger adults - You're overweight - You have a family history of the disease - You have one of various conditions that can increase your risk of developing pulmonary hypertension - You use illegal drugs, such as cocaine - You take certain appetite-suppressant medications - You have an existing risk of developing pulmonary hypertension, such as a family history of the condition, and you live at a high altitude Diagnosis Pulmonary hypertension is hard to diagnose early because it's not often detected in a routine physical exam. Even when the condition is more advanced, its signs and symptoms are similar to those of other heart and lung conditions. To diagnose your condition, your doctor may review your medical and family history, discuss your signs and symptoms, and conduct a physical examination. Doctors may order several tests to diagnose pulmonary hypertension, determine the severity of your condition and find out the cause of your condition. Tests may include: - Echocardiogram. Sound waves can create moving images of the beating heart. An echocardiogram can help your doctor to check the size and functioning of the right ventricle, and the thickness of the right ventricle's wall. An echocardiogram can also show how well your heart chambers and valves are working. Doctors may also use this to measure the pressure in your pulmonary arteries. In some cases, your doctor will recommend an exercise echocardiogram to help determine how well your heart and lungs work under stress. In this test, you'll have an echocardiogram before exercising on a stationary bike or treadmill and another test immediately afterward. This could be done as an oxygen consumption test, in which you may have to wear a mask that assesses the ability of your heart and lungs to deal with oxygen and carbon dioxide. Other exercise tests may also be done. These tests can help determine the severity and cause of your condition. They may also be done at follow-up appointments to check that your treatments are working. - Chest X-ray. A chest X-ray can show images of your heart, lungs and chest. This test can show enlargement of the right ventricle of the heart or the pulmonary arteries, which can occur in pulmonary hypertension. This test can also be used to identify other conditions that may be causing pulmonary hypertension. - Electrocardiogram (ECG). This noninvasive test shows your heart's electrical patterns and can detect abnormal rhythms. Doctors may also be able to see signs of right ventricle enlargement or strain. - Right heart catheterization. After you've had an echocardiogram, if your doctor thinks you have pulmonary hypertension, you'll likely have a right heart catheterization. This test can often help confirm that you have pulmonary hypertension and determine the severity of your condition. During the procedure, a cardiologist places a thin, flexible tube (catheter) into a vein in your neck or groin. The catheter is then threaded into your right ventricle and pulmonary artery. Right heart catheterization allows your doctor to directly measure the pressure in the main pulmonary arteries and right ventricle. It's also used to see what effect different medications may have on your pulmonary hypertension. - Blood tests. Your doctor might order blood tests to check for certain substances in your blood that might show you have pulmonary hypertension or its complications. Blood tests can also test for certain conditions that may be causing your condition. Your doctor might order additional tests to check the condition of your lungs and pulmonary arteries and to determine the cause of your condition, including: - Computerized tomography (CT) scan. During a CT scan, you lie on a table inside a doughnut-shaped machine. CT scanning generates X-rays to produce cross-sectional images of your body. Doctors may inject a dye into your blood vessels that helps your arteries to be more visible on the CT pictures (CT angiography). Doctors may use this test to look at the heart's size and function and to check for blood clots in the lungs' arteries. - Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). This test may be used to check the right ventricle's function and the blood flow in the lung's arteries. In this test, you lie on a movable table that slides into the tunnel. An MRI uses a magnetic field and pulses of radio wave energy to make pictures of the body. - Pulmonary function test. This noninvasive test measures how much air your lungs can hold, and the airflow in and out of your lungs. During the test, you'll blow into a simple instrument called a spirometer. - Polysomnogram. This test detects your brain activity, heart rate, blood pressure, oxygen levels and other factors while you sleep. It can help diagnose a sleep disorder such as obstructive sleep apnea. - Ventilation/perfusion (V/Q) scan. In this test, a tracer is injected into a vein in your arm. The tracer maps blood flow and air to your lungs. This test can be used to determine whether blood clots are causing symptoms of pulmonary hypertension. - Open-lung biopsy. Rarely, a doctor might recommend an open-lung biopsy. An open-lung biopsy is a type of surgery in which a small sample of tissue is removed from your lungs under general anesthesia to check for a possible secondary cause of pulmonary hypertension. Genetic tests If a family member has had pulmonary hypertension, your doctor might screen you for genes that are linked with pulmonary hypertension. If you test positive, your doctor might recommend that other family members be screened for the same genetic mutation. Pulmonary hypertension classifications Once you've been diagnosed with pulmonary hypertension, your doctor might classify the severity of your disease into one of several classes, including: - Class I. Although you've been diagnosed with pulmonary hypertension, you have no symptoms with normal activity. - Class II. You don't have symptoms at rest, but you experience symptoms such as fatigue, shortness of breath or chest pain with normal activity. - Class III. You're comfortable at rest, but have symptoms when you're physically active. - Class IV. You have symptoms with physical activity and while at rest. Treatment Pulmonary hypertension can't be cured, but doctors can help you manage your condition. Treatment may help improve your symptoms and slow the progress of pulmonary hypertension. It often takes some time to find the most appropriate treatment for pulmonary hypertension. The treatments are often complex and require extensive follow-up care. Your doctor might also need to change your treatment if it's no longer effective. When pulmonary hypertension is caused by another condition, your doctor will treat the underlying cause whenever possible. Medications - Blood vessel dilators (vasodilators). Vasodilators open narrowed blood vessels. One of the most commonly prescribed vasodilators for pulmonary hypertension is epoprostenol (Flolan, Veletri). The drawback to epoprostenol is that its effects last only a few minutes. This drug is continuously injected through an intravenous (IV) catheter via a small pump that you wear in a pack on your belt or shoulder. Potential side effects of epoprostenol include jaw pain, nausea, diarrhea and leg cramps, as well as pain and infection at the IV site. Another form of the drug, iloprost (Ventavis), can be inhaled six to nine times a day through a nebulizer, a machine that vaporizes your medication. Because it's inhaled, it goes directly to the lungs. Side effects associated with iloprost include chest pain - often accompanied by a headache and nausea - and breathlessness. Treprostinil (Tyvaso, Remodulin, Orenitram), another form of the drug, can be given four times a day. It can be inhaled, taken as oral medication or administered by injection. It can cause side effects such as a headache, nausea and diarrhea. - Endothelin receptor antagonists. These medications reverse the effect of endothelin, a substance in the walls of blood vessels that causes them to narrow. These drugs may improve your energy level and symptoms. However, these drugs shouldn't be taken if you're pregnant. Also, these drugs can damage your liver and you may need monthly liver monitoring. These medications include bosentan (Tracleer), macitentan (Opsumit), and ambrisentan (Letairis). - Sildenafil and tadalafil. Sildenafil (Revatio, Viagra) and tadalafil (Cialis, Adcirca) are sometimes used to treat pulmonary hypertension. These drugs work by opening the blood vessels in the lungs to allow blood to flow through more easily. Side effects can include an upset stomach, headache and vision problems. - High-dose calcium channel blockers. These drugs help relax the muscles in the walls of your blood vessels. They include medications such as amlodipine (Norvasc), diltiazem (Cardizem, Tiazac, others) and nifedipine (Procardia, others). Although calcium channel blockers can be effective, only a small number of people with pulmonary hypertension respond to them. - Soluble guanylate cyclase (SGC) stimulator. Soluble guanylate cyclase (SGC) stimulators (Adempas) interact with nitric oxide and help relax the pulmonary arteries and lower the pressure within the arteries. These medications should not be taken if you're pregnant. They can sometimes cause dizziness or nausea. - Anticoagulants. Your doctor is likely to prescribe the anticoagulant warfarin (Coumadin, Jantoven) to help prevent the formation of blood clots within the small pulmonary arteries. Because anticoagulants prevent normal blood coagulation, they increase your risk of bleeding complications. Take warfarin exactly as prescribed, because warfarin can cause severe side effects if taken incorrectly. If you're taking warfarin, your doctor will ask you to have periodic blood tests to check how well the drug is working. Many other drugs, herbal supplements and foods can interact with warfarin, so be sure your doctor knows all of the medications you're taking. - Digoxin. Digoxin (Lanoxin) can help the heart beat stronger and pump more blood. It can help control the heart rate if you experience arrhythmias. - Diuretics. Commonly known as water pills, these medications help eliminate excess fluid from your body. This reduces the amount of work your heart has to do. They may also be used to limit fluid buildup in your lungs. - Oxygen. Your doctor might suggest that you sometimes breathe pure oxygen, a treatment known as oxygen therapy, to help treat pulmonary hypertension, especially if you live at a high altitude or have sleep apnea. Some people who have pulmonary hypertension eventually require continuous oxygen therapy. Surgeries - Atrial septostomy. If medications don't control your pulmonary hypertension, this open-heart surgery might be an option. In an atrial septostomy, a surgeon will create an opening between the upper left and right chambers of your heart (atria) to relieve the pressure on the right side of your heart. Atrial septostomy can have serious complications, including heart rhythm abnormalities (arrhythmias). - Transplantation. In some cases, a lung or heart-lung transplant might be an option, especially for younger people who have idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension. Major risks of any type of transplantation include rejection of the transplanted organ and serious infection, and you must take immunosuppressant drugs for life to help reduce the chance of rejection. Lifestyle and home remedies Although medical treatment can't cure pulmonary hypertension, it can lessen symptoms. Lifestyle changes also can help improve your condition. Consider these tips: - Get plenty of rest. Resting can reduce the fatigue that might come from having pulmonary hypertension. - Stay as active as possible. Even the mildest forms of activity might be too exhausting for some people who have pulmonary hypertension. For others, moderate exercise such as walking might be beneficial - especially when done with oxygen. But first, talk to your doctor about specific exercise restrictions. In most cases, it's recommended that you not lift heavy weights. Your doctor can help you plan an appropriate exercise program. - Don't smoke. If you smoke, the most important thing you can do for your heart and lungs is to stop. If you can't stop smoking by yourself, ask your doctor to prescribe a treatment plan to help you quit. Also, avoid secondhand smoke if possible. - Avoid pregnancy and birth control pills. If you're a woman of childbearing age, avoid pregnancy. Pregnancy can be life-threatening for both you and your baby. Also avoid using birth control pills, which can increase your risk of blood clots. Talk to your doctor about alternative forms of birth control. If you do become pregnant, it's important to consult with your doctor as pulmonary hypertension can cause serious complications to both you and the fetus. - Avoid traveling to or living at high altitudes. High altitudes can worsen the symptoms of pulmonary hypertension. If you live at an altitude of 8,000 feet (2,438 meters) or higher, your doctor might recommend that you move to a lower altitude. - Avoid situations that can excessively lower blood pressure. These include sitting in a hot tub or sauna or taking long hot baths or showers. These activities lower your blood pressure and can cause fainting or even death. Also avoid activities that cause prolonged straining, such as lifting heavy objects or weights. - Follow a nutritious diet and stay at a healthy weight. Aim to eat a healthy diet of whole grains, a variety of fruits and vegetables, lean meats and low-fat dairy products. Avoid saturated fat, trans fat and cholesterol. It's likely your doctor will recommend limiting the amount of salt in your diet. Aim to maintain a healthy weight. - Ask your doctor about medications. Take all your medications as prescribed. Ask your doctor about any other medications before taking them, as some can interfere with your medication or worsen your condition. - See your doctor at follow-up appointments. Your doctor may recommend regular follow-up appointments. Let your doctor know if you have any questions about your condition or medications you're taking, or if you have any symptoms or side effects from your medications. If pulmonary hypertension is affecting your quality of life, ask your doctor about options that could improve your quality of life. - Get vaccines. Your doctor may recommend getting an influenza and pneumonia vaccine, as these conditions can cause serious issues for people with pulmonary hypertension. - Get support. If you're feeling stressed or worried due to your condition, get support from family or friends. Or, consider joining a support group with others who have pulmonary hypertension. ",

        "article": " Pulmonary Hypertension What Is... Pulmonary hypertension (PULL-mun-ary HI-per-TEN-shun), or PH, is increased pressure in the pulmonary arteries. These arteries carry blood from your heart to your lungs to pick up oxygen. PH causes symptoms such as shortness of breath during routine activity (for example, climbing two flights of stairs), tiredness, chest pain, and a racing heartbeat. As the condition worsens, its symptoms may limit all physical activity. Overview To understand PH, it helps to understand how your heart and lungs work. Your heart has two sides, separated by an inner wall called the septum. Each side of your heart has an upper and lower chamber. The lower right chamber of your heart, the right ventricle (VEN-trih-kul), pumps blood to your pulmonary arteries. The blood then travels to your lungs, where it picks up oxygen. The upper left chamber of your heart, the left atrium (AY-tree-um), receives the oxygen-rich blood from your lungs. The blood is then pumped into the lower left chamber of your heart, the left ventricle. From the left ventricle, the blood is pumped to the rest of your body through an artery called the aorta. For more information about the heart and lungs, go to the Diseases and Conditions Index How the Heart Works and How the Lungs Work articles. PH begins with inflammation and changes in the cells that line your pulmonary arteries. Other factors also can affect the pulmonary arteries and cause PH. For example, the condition may develop if: The walls of the arteries tighten. The walls of the arteries are stiff at birth or become stiff from an overgrowth of cells. Blood clots form in the arteries. These changes make it hard for your heart to push blood through your pulmonary arteries and into your lungs. As a result, the pressure in your arteries rises. Also, because your heart is working harder than normal, your right ventricle becomes strained and weak. Your heart may become so weak that it can't pump enough blood to your lungs. This causes heart failure. Heart failure is the most common cause of death in people who have PH. PH is divided into five groups based on its causes. In all groups, the average pressure in the pulmonary arteries is higher than 25 mmHg at rest or 30 mmHg during physical activity. The pressure in normal pulmonary arteries is 8\u201320 mmHg at rest. (The mmHg is millimeters of mercury\u2014the units used to measure blood pressure.) Other diseases or conditions, such as heart and lung diseases or blood clots, usually cause PH. Some people inherit the condition (that is, their parents pass the genes for PH on to them). In some cases, the cause isn't known. Outlook PH has no cure. However, research for new treatments is ongoing. The earlier PH is treated, the easier it is to control. Treatments include medicines, procedures, and other therapies. These treatments can relieve PH symptoms and slow the progress of the disease. Lifestyle changes also can help control symptoms. Types The World Health Organization divides pulmonary hypertension (PH) into five groups. These groups are organized based on the cause of the condition. In all groups, the average pressure in the pulmonary arteries is higher than 25 mmHg at rest or 30 mmHg during physical activity. The pressure in normal pulmonary arteries is 8\u201320 mmHg at rest. (Note that group 1 is called pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) and groups 2 through 5 are called pulmonary hypertension. However, together all groups are called pulmonary hypertension.) Group 1 Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension Group 1 PAH includes: PAH that has no known cause. PAH that's inherited (passed from parents to children through genes). PAH that's caused by drugs or toxins, such as street drugs and certain diet medicines. PAH that's caused by conditions such as: - Connective tissue diseases. (Connective tissue helps support all parts of your body, including your skin, eyes, and heart.) - HIV infection. - Liver disease. - Congenital heart disease. This is heart disease that's present at birth. - Sickle cell disease. - Schistosomiasis (SKIS-toe-so-MI-ah-sis). This is an infection caused by a parasite. Schistosomiasis is one of the most common causes of PAH in many parts of the world. Connective tissue diseases. (Connective tissue helps support all parts of your body, including your skin, eyes, and heart.) HIV infection. Liver disease. Congenital heart disease. This is heart disease that's present at birth. Sickle cell disease. Schistosomiasis (SKIS-toe-so-MI-ah-sis). This is an infection caused by a parasite. Schistosomiasis is one of the most common causes of PAH in many parts of the world. PAH that's caused by conditions that affect the veins and small blood vessels of the lungs. Group 2 Pulmonary Hypertension Group 2 includes PH with left heart disease. Conditions that affect the left side of the heart, such as mitral valve disease or long-term high blood pressure, can cause left heart disease and PH. Left heart disease is likely the most common cause of PH. Group 3 Pulmonary Hypertension Group 3 includes PH associated with lung diseases, such as COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) and interstitial (IN-ter-STISH-al) lung diseases. Interstitial lung diseases cause scarring of the lung tissue. Group 3 also includes PH associated with sleep-related breathing disorders, such as sleep apnea. Group 4 Pulmonary Hypertension Group 4 includes PH caused by blood clots in the lungs or blood clotting disorders. Group 5 Pulmonary Hypertension Group 5 includes PH caused by various other diseases or conditions. Examples include: Blood disorders, such as polycythemia vera (POL-e-si-THE-me-ah VAY-rah or VE-rah) and essential thrombocythemia (THROM-bo-si-THE-me-ah). Systemic disorders, such as sarcoidosis (sar-koy-DO-sis) and vasculitis (vas-kyu-LI-tis). Systemic disorders involve many of the body's organs. Metabolic disorders, such as thyroid disease and glycogen storage disease. (In glycogen storage disease, the body's cells don't use a form of glucose (sugar) properly.) Other conditions, such as tumors that press on the pulmonary arteries and kidney disease. Other Names Group 1 pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) that occurs without a known cause often is called primary PAH or idiopathic (id-ee-o-PATH-ick) PAH. Group 1 PAH that occurs with a known cause often is called associated PAH. For example, PAH that occurs in a person who has scleroderma might be called \"PAH occurring in association with scleroderma,\" or simply \"scleroderma-associated PAH.\" Groups 2\u20135 pulmonary hypertension (PH) sometimes are called secondary PH. Causes Pulmonary hypertension (PH) begins with inflammation and changes in the cells that line your pulmonary arteries. Other factors also can affect the pulmonary arteries and cause PH. For example, the condition may develop if: The walls of the arteries tighten. The walls of the arteries are stiff at birth or become stiff from an overgrowth of cells. Blood clots form in the arteries. These changes make it hard for your heart to push blood through your pulmonary arteries and into your lungs. Thus, the pressure in the arteries rises, causing PH. Many factors can contribute to the process that leads to the different types of PH. Group 1 pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) may have no known cause, or the condition may be inherited. (\"Inherited\" means the condition is passed from parents to children through genes.) Some diseases and conditions also can cause group 1 PAH. Examples include HIV infection, congenital heart disease, and sickle cell disease. Also, the use of street drugs (such as cocaine) and certain diet medicines can lead to PAH. Many diseases and conditions can cause groups 2 through 5 PH (often called secondary PH), including: Mitral valve disease Lung diseases, such as COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) Sleep apnea Sarcoidosis For more information about the types of PH and the diseases, conditions, and factors that can cause them, go to \"Types of Pulmonary Hypertension.\" Who Is at Risk The exact number of people who have pulmonary hypertension (PH) isn't known. Group 1 pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) without a known cause is rare. It affects women more often than men. People who have group 1 PAH tend to be overweight. PH that occurs with another disease or condition is more common. PH usually develops between the ages of 20 and 60, but it can occur at any age. People who are at increased risk for PH include: Those who have a family history of the condition. Those who have certain diseases or conditions, such as heart and lung diseases, liver disease, HIV infection, or blood clots in the pulmonary arteries. (For more information about the diseases, conditions, and factors that cause PH, go to \"Types of Pulmonary Hypertension.\") Those who use street drugs (such as cocaine) or certain diet medicines. Those who live at high altitudes. Signs & Symptoms Signs and symptoms of pulmonary hypertension (PH) may include: Shortness of breath during routine activity, such as climbing two flights of stairs Tiredness Chest pain A racing heartbeat Pain on the upper right side of the abdomen Decreased appetite As PH worsens, you may find it hard to do any physical activities. At this point, other signs and symptoms may include: Feeling light-headed, especially during physical activity Fainting at times Swelling in your legs and ankles A bluish color on your lips and skin Diagnosis Your doctor will diagnose pulmonary hypertension (PH) based on your medical and family histories, a physical exam, and the results from tests and procedures. PH can develop slowly. In fact, you may have it for years and not know it. This is because the condition has no early signs or symptoms. When symptoms do occur, they're often like those of other heart and lung conditions, such as asthma. This makes PH hard to diagnose. Medical and Family Histories Your doctor may ask about your signs and symptoms and how and when they began. He or she also may ask whether you have other medical conditions that can cause PH. Your doctor will want to know whether you have any family members who have or have had PH. People who have a family history of PH are at higher risk for the condition. Physical Exam During the physical exam, your doctor will listen to your heart and lungs with a stethoscope. He or she also will check your ankles and legs for swelling and your lips and skin for a bluish color. These are signs of PH. Diagnostic Tests and Procedures Your doctor may recommend tests and procedures to confirm a diagnosis of PH and to look for its underlying cause. Your doctor also will use test results to find out the severity of your PH. Tests and Procedures To Confirm a Diagnosis Echocardiography. Echocardiography (EK-o-kar-de-OG-ra-fee), or echo, uses sound waves to create a moving picture of your heart. This test can estimate the pressure in your pulmonary arteries. Echo also can show the size and thickness of your right ventricle and how well it's working. Chest x ray. A chest x ray takes pictures of the structures in your chest, such as your heart, lungs, and blood vessels. This test can show whether your pulmonary arteries and right ventricle are enlarged. The pulmonary arteries and right ventricle may get larger if the right ventricle has to work hard to pump blood through the pulmonary arteries. A chest x ray also may show signs of an underlying lung disease that's causing or contributing to PH. EKG (electrocardiogram). An EKG is a simple, painless test that records the heart's electrical activity. This test also shows whether your heart's rhythm is steady or irregular. An EKG may show whether your right ventricle is enlarged or strained. Right heart catheterization. This procedure measures the pressure in your pulmonary arteries. It also shows how well your heart is pumping blood to the rest of your body. Right heart catheterization (KATH-e-ter-ih-ZA-shun) can find any leaks between the left and right side of the heart. During this procedure, a thin, flexible tube called a catheter is put into a blood vessel in your groin (upper thigh) or neck. The tube is threaded into the right side of your heart and into the pulmonary arteries. Through the tube, your doctor can do tests and treatments on your heart. Tests To Look for the Underlying Cause of Pulmonary Hypertension PH has many causes, so many tests may need to be done to find its underlying cause. Chest CT scan. A chest computed tomography (to-MOG-ra-fee) scan, or chest CT scan, creates pictures of the structures inside your chest, such as your heart, lungs, and blood vessels. These pictures can show signs of PH or a condition that may be causing PH. Chest MRI. Chest magnetic resonance imaging, or chest MRI, shows how your right ventricle is working. The test also shows blood flow in your lungs. Chest MRI also can help detect signs of PH or an underlying condition causing PH. Lung function tests. Lung function tests measure how much air you can breathe in and out, how fast you can breathe air out, and how well your lungs deliver oxygen to your blood. These tests can help detect a lung disease that may be causing PH. Polysomnogram (PSG). This test records brain activity, eye movements, heart rate, and blood pressure while you sleep. A PSG also measures the level of oxygen in your blood. A low oxygen level during sleep is common in PH, and it can make the condition worse. A PSG usually is done while you stay overnight at a sleep center. For more information about this test, go to the Diseases and Conditions Index Sleep Studies article. Lung ventilation/perfusion (VQ) scan. A lung VQ scan measures air and blood flow in your lungs. This test can help detect blood clots in your lung's blood vessels. Blood tests. Blood tests are used to rule out other diseases, such as HIV, liver disease, and autoimmune diseases (such as rheumatoid arthritis). Finding Out the Severity of Pulmonary Hypertension Exercise testing is used to find out the severity of PH. This testing consists of either a 6-minute walk test or a cardiopulmonary exercise test. A 6-minute walk test measures the distance you can quickly walk in 6 minutes. A cardiopulmonary exercise test measures how well your lungs and heart work while you exercise on a treadmill or bicycle. During exercise testing, your doctor will rate your activity level. Your level is linked to the severity of your PH. The rating system ranges from class 1 to class 4. Class 1 has no limits. You can do regular physical activities, such as walking or climbing stairs. These activities don't cause PH symptoms, such as tiredness, shortness of breath, or chest pain. Class 2 has slight or mild limits. You're comfortable while resting, but regular physical activity causes PH symptoms. Class 3 has marked or noticeable limits. You're comfortable while resting. However, walking even one or two blocks or climbing one flight of stairs can cause PH symptoms. Class 4 has severe limits. You're not able to do any physical activity without discomfort. You also may have PH symptoms while at rest. Over time, you may need more exercise tests to find out how well your treatments are working. Each time testing is done, your doctor will compare your activity level with the previous one. Treatment Pulmonary hypertension (PH) has no cure. However, treatment may help relieve symptoms and slow the progress of the disease. PH is treated with medicines, procedures, and other therapies. Treatment will depend on what type of PH you have and its severity. (For more information, go to \"Types of Pulmonary Hypertension.\") Group 1 Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension Group 1 pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) includes PH that's inherited, that has no known cause, or that's caused by certain drugs or conditions. Treatments for group 1 PAH include medicines and medical procedures. Medicines Your doctor may prescribe medicines to relax the blood vessels in your lungs and reduce excess cell growth in the blood vessels. As the blood vessels relax, more blood can flow through them. Your doctor may prescribe medicines that are taken by mouth, inhaled, or injected. Examples of medicines for group 1 PAH include: Phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors, such as sildenafil Prostanoids, such as epoprostenol Endothelin receptor antagonists, such as bosentan and ambrisentan Calcium channel blockers, such as diltiazem Your doctor may prescribe one or more of these medicines. To find out which of these medicines works best, you'll likely have an acute vasoreactivity test. This test shows how the pressure in your pulmonary arteries reacts to certain medicines. The test is done during right heart catheterization. Medical and Surgical Procedures If you have group 1 PAH, your doctor may recommend one or more of the following procedures. Atrial septostomy (sep-TOS-toe-me). For this procedure, a thin, flexible tube called a catheter is put into a blood vessel in your leg and threaded to your heart. The tube is then put through the wall that separates your right and left atria (the upper chambers of your heart). This wall is called the septum. A tiny balloon on the tip of the tube is inflated. This creates an opening between the atria. This procedure relieves the pressure in the right atria and increases blood flow. Atrial septostomy is rarely done in the United States. Lung transplant. A lung transplant is surgery to replace a person's diseased lung with a healthy lung from a deceased donor. This procedure may be used for people who have severe lung disease that's causing PAH. Heart\u2013lung transplant. A heart\u2013lung transplant is surgery in which both the heart and lung are replaced with healthy organs from a deceased donor. Group 2 Pulmonary Hypertension Conditions that affect the left side of the heart, such as mitral valve disease, can cause group 2 PH. Treating the underlying condition will help treat PH. Treatments may include lifestyle changes, medicines, and surgery. Group 3 Pulmonary Hypertension Lung diseases, such as COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) and interstitial lung disease, can cause group 3 PH. Certain sleep disorders, such as sleep apnea, also can cause group 3 PH. If you have this type of PH, you may need oxygen therapy. This treatment raises the level of oxygen in your blood. You'll likely get the oxygen through soft, plastic prongs that fit into your nose. Oxygen therapy can be done at home or in a hospital. Your doctor also may recommend other treatments if you have an underlying lung disease. Group 4 Pulmonary Hypertension Blood clots in the lungs or blood clotting disorders can cause group 4 PH. If you have this type of PH, your doctor will likely prescribe blood-thinning medicines. These medicines prevent clots from forming or getting larger. Sometimes doctors use surgery to remove scarring in the pulmonary arteries due to old blood clots. Group 5 Pulmonary Hypertension Various diseases and conditions, such as thyroid disease and sarcoidosis, can cause group 5 PH. An object, such as a tumor, pressing on the pulmonary arteries also can cause group 5 PH. Group 5 PH is treated by treating its cause. All Types of Pulmonary Hypertension Several treatments may be used for all types of PH. These treatments include: Diuretics, also called water pills. These medicines help reduce fluid buildup in your body, including swelling in your ankles and feet. Blood-thinning medicines. These medicines help prevent blood clots from forming or getting larger. Digoxin. This medicine helps the heart beat stronger and pump more blood. Digoxin sometimes is used to control the heart rate if abnormal heart rhythms, such as atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter, occur. Oxygen therapy. This treatment raises the level of oxygen in your blood. Physical activity. Regular activity may help improve your ability to be active. Talk with your doctor about a physical activity plan that's safe for you. Research is ongoing for better PH treatments. These treatments offer hope for the future. Living With Pulmonary hypertension (PH) has no cure. However, you can work with your doctor to manage your symptoms and slow the progress of the disease. Ongoing Care Follow your treatment plan as your doctor advises. Call your doctor if your PH symptoms worsen or change. The earlier symptoms are addressed, the easier it is to treat them. Some symptoms, such as chest pain, may require emergency treatment. Ask your doctor when you should call him or her or seek emergency care. Also, talk with your doctor before taking any over-the-counter medicines. Some medicines can make your PH worse or interfere with the medicines you're taking for PH. Ask your doctor whether you should get a pneumonia vaccine and a yearly flu shot. You may have a complex schedule for taking medicines. Call your doctor or nurse if you're having problems with this schedule. Knowing the names of your medicines and how they work is helpful. Keep a list of your medicines with you. Don't stop or change medicines unless you talk with your doctor first. Pay careful attention to your weight. You may want to keep a daily record of your weight. You should weigh yourself at the same time each day. If you notice a rapid weight gain (2 or more pounds in 1 day or 5 or more pounds in 1 week), call your doctor. This may be a sign that your PH is worsening. Pregnancy is risky for women who have PH. Consider using birth control if there is a chance you may become pregnant. Ask your doctor which birth control methods are safe for you. Lifestyle Changes Making lifestyle changes can help you manage your symptoms. These changes will depend on the type of PH you have. Talk with your doctor about which lifestyle changes can help you. Quit Smoking If you smoke, quit. Smoking makes PH symptoms worse. Ask your doctor about programs and products that can help you quit. Also, avoid exposure to secondhand smoke. For more information about how to quit smoking, go to the Diseases and Conditions Index Smoking and Your Heart article and the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute's (NHLBI's) \"Your Guide to a Healthy Heart.\" Although these resources focus on heart health, they both include general information about how to quit smoking. Follow a Healthy Diet Following a healthy diet and maintaining a healthy weight are part of a healthy lifestyle. A healthy diet includes a variety of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. It also includes lean meats, poultry, fish, and fat-free or low-fat milk or milk products. A healthy diet also is low in saturated fat, trans fat, cholesterol, sodium (salt), and added sugar. Talk with your doctor about whether you need to limit the amount of salt and fluids in your diet. Ask him or her whether you also need to regulate foods that contain vitamin K. These foods can affect how well blood-thinning medicines work. Vitamin K is found in green leafy vegetables and some oils, such as canola and soybean oil. For more information about following a healthy diet, go to the NHLBI's Aim for a Healthy Weight Web site, \"Your Guide to a Healthy Heart,\" and \"Your Guide to Lowering Your Blood Pressure With DASH.\" All of these resources include general advice about healthy eating. The DASH eating plan focuses on reduced-sodium foods, which may be helpful if your doctor advises you to limit the salt in your diet. Be Physically Active Physical activity is an important part of a healthy lifestyle. Try to do physical activity, such as walking, regularly. This will keep your muscles strong and help you stay active. Ask your doctor how much activity is safe for you. Your doctor may tell you to limit or avoid certain activities, such as: Those that cause straining, such as lifting heavy objects or weights. Sitting in a hot tub or sauna or taking long baths. These activities can lower your blood pressure too much. Flying in an airplane or traveling to high-altitude areas. Your doctor may ask you to use extra oxygen during air travel. Avoid activities that cause breathing problems, dizziness, or chest pain. If you have any of these symptoms, seek care right away. Emotional Issues and Support Living with PH may cause fear, anxiety, depression, and stress. You may worry about your medical condition, treatment, finances, and other issues. Talk about how you feel with your health care team. Talking to a professional counselor also can help. If you're very depressed, your doctor may recommend medicines or other treatments that can improve your quality of life. Joining a patient support group may help you adjust to living with PH. You can see how other people who have the same symptoms have coped with them. Talk with your doctor about local support groups or check with an area medical center. Support from family and friends also can help relieve stress and anxiety. Let your loved ones know how you feel and what they can do to help you. ",

        "article": " Pulmonary Hypertension What Is... Pulmonary hypertension (PULL-mun-ary HI-per-TEN-shun), or PH, is increased pressure in the pulmonary arteries. These arteries carry blood from your heart to your lungs to pick up oxygen. PH causes symptoms such as shortness of breath during routine activity (for example, climbing two flights of stairs), tiredness, chest pain, and a racing heartbeat. As the condition worsens, its symptoms may limit all physical activity. Overview To understand PH, it helps to understand how your heart and lungs work. Your heart has two sides, separated by an inner wall called the septum. Each side of your heart has an upper and lower chamber. The lower right chamber of your heart, the right ventricle (VEN-trih-kul), pumps blood to your pulmonary arteries. The blood then travels to your lungs, where it picks up oxygen. The upper left chamber of your heart, the left atrium (AY-tree-um), receives the oxygen-rich blood from your lungs. The blood is then pumped into the lower left chamber of your heart, the left ventricle. From the left ventricle, the blood is pumped to the rest of your body through an artery called the aorta. For more information about the heart and lungs, go to the Diseases and Conditions Index How the Heart Works and How the Lungs Work articles. PH begins with inflammation and changes in the cells that line your pulmonary arteries. Other factors also can affect the pulmonary arteries and cause PH. For example, the condition may develop if: The walls of the arteries tighten. The walls of the arteries are stiff at birth or become stiff from an overgrowth of cells. Blood clots form in the arteries. These changes make it hard for your heart to push blood through your pulmonary arteries and into your lungs. As a result, the pressure in your arteries rises. Also, because your heart is working harder than normal, your right ventricle becomes strained and weak. Your heart may become so weak that it can't pump enough blood to your lungs. This causes heart failure. Heart failure is the most common cause of death in people who have PH. PH is divided into five groups based on its causes. In all groups, the average pressure in the pulmonary arteries is higher than 25 mmHg at rest or 30 mmHg during physical activity. The pressure in normal pulmonary arteries is 8\u201320 mmHg at rest. (The mmHg is millimeters of mercury\u2014the units used to measure blood pressure.) Other diseases or conditions, such as heart and lung diseases or blood clots, usually cause PH. Some people inherit the condition (that is, their parents pass the genes for PH on to them). In some cases, the cause isn't known. Outlook PH has no cure. However, research for new treatments is ongoing. The earlier PH is treated, the easier it is to control. Treatments include medicines, procedures, and other therapies. These treatments can relieve PH symptoms and slow the progress of the disease. Lifestyle changes also can help control symptoms.

Other conditions, such as tumors that press on the pulmonary arteries and kidney disease. Other Names Group 1 pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) that occurs without a known cause often is called primary PAH or idiopathic (id-ee-o-PATH-ick) PAH. Group 1 PAH that occurs with a known cause often is called associated PAH. For example, PAH that occurs in a person who has scleroderma might be called \"PAH occurring in association with scleroderma,\" or simply \"scleroderma-associated PAH.\" Groups 2\u20135 pulmonary hypertension (PH) sometimes are called secondary PH. Causes Pulmonary hypertension (PH) begins with inflammation and changes in the cells that line your pulmonary arteries. Other factors also can affect the pulmonary arteries and cause PH. For example, the condition may develop if: The walls of the arteries tighten. The walls of the arteries are stiff at birth or become stiff from an overgrowth of cells. Blood clots form in the arteries. These changes make it hard for your heart to push blood through your pulmonary arteries and into your lungs. Thus, the pressure in the arteries rises, causing PH. Many factors can contribute to the process that leads to the different types of PH. Group 1 pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) may have no known cause, or the condition may be inherited. (\"Inherited\" means the condition is passed from parents to children through genes.) Some diseases and conditions also can cause group 1 PAH. Examples include HIV infection, congenital heart disease, and sickle cell disease. Also, the use of street drugs (such as cocaine) and certain diet medicines can lead to PAH. Many diseases and conditions can cause groups 2 through 5 PH (often called secondary PH), including: Mitral valve disease Lung diseases, such as COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) Sleep apnea Sarcoidosis For more information about the types of PH and the diseases, conditions, and factors that can cause them, go to \"Types of Pulmonary Hypertension.\" Who Is at Risk The exact number of people who have pulmonary hypertension (PH) isn't known. Group 1 pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) without a known cause is rare. It affects women more often than men. People who have group 1 PAH tend to be overweight. PH that occurs with another disease or condition is more common. PH usually develops between the ages of 20 and 60, but it can occur at any age. People who are at increased risk for PH include: Those who have a family history of the condition. Those who have certain diseases or conditions, such as heart and lung diseases, liver disease, HIV infection, or blood clots in the pulmonary arteries. (For more information about the diseases, conditions, and factors that cause PH, go to \"Types of Pulmonary Hypertension.\") Those who use street drugs (such as cocaine) or certain diet medicines. Those who live at high altitudes. Signs & Symptoms Signs and symptoms of pulmonary hypertension (PH) may include: Shortness of breath during routine activity, such as climbing two flights of stairs Tiredness Chest pain A racing heartbeat Pain on the upper right side of the abdomen Decreased appetite As PH worsens, you may find it hard to do any physical activities. At this point, other signs and symptoms may include: Feeling light-headed, especially during physical activity Fainting at times Swelling in your legs and ankles A bluish color on your lips and skin Diagnosis Your doctor will diagnose pulmonary hypertension (PH) based on your medical and family histories, a physical exam, and the results from tests and procedures. PH can develop slowly. In fact, you may have it for years and not know it. This is because the condition has no early signs or symptoms. When symptoms do occur, they're often like those of other heart and lung conditions, such as asthma. This makes PH hard to diagnose. Medical and Family Histories Your doctor may ask about your signs and symptoms and how and when they began. He or she also may ask whether you have other medical conditions that can cause PH. Your doctor will want to know whether you have any family members who have or have had PH. People who have a family history of PH are at higher risk for the condition. Physical Exam During the physical exam, your doctor will listen to your heart and lungs with a stethoscope. He or she also will check your ankles and legs for swelling and your lips and skin for a bluish color. These are signs of PH. Diagnostic Tests and Procedures Your doctor may recommend tests and procedures to confirm a diagnosis of PH and to look for its underlying cause. Your doctor also will use test results to find out the severity of your PH. Tests and Procedures To Confirm a Diagnosis Echocardiography. Echocardiography (EK-o-kar-de-OG-ra-fee), or echo, uses sound waves to create a moving picture of your heart. This test can estimate the pressure in your pulmonary arteries. Echo also can show the size and thickness of your right ventricle and how well it's working. Chest x ray. A chest x ray takes pictures of the structures in your chest, such as your heart, lungs, and blood vessels. This test can show whether your pulmonary arteries and right ventricle are enlarged. The pulmonary arteries and right ventricle may get larger if the right ventricle has to work hard to pump blood through the pulmonary arteries. A chest x ray also may show signs of an underlying lung disease that's causing or contributing to PH. EKG (electrocardiogram). An EKG is a simple, painless test that records the heart's electrical activity. This test also shows whether your heart's rhythm is steady or irregular. An EKG may show whether your right ventricle is enlarged or strained. Right heart catheterization. This procedure measures the pressure in your pulmonary arteries. It also shows how well your heart is pumping blood to the rest of your body. Right heart catheterization (KATH-e-ter-ih-ZA-shun) can find any leaks between the left and right side of the heart. During this procedure, a thin, flexible tube called a catheter is put into a blood vessel in your groin (upper thigh) or neck. The tube is threaded into the right side of your heart and into the pulmonary arteries. Through the tube, your doctor can do tests and treatments on your heart. Tests To Look for the Underlying Cause of Pulmonary Hypertension PH has many causes, so many tests may need to be done to find its underlying cause. Chest CT scan. A chest computed tomography (to-MOG-ra-fee) scan, or chest CT scan, creates pictures of the structures inside your chest, such as your heart, lungs, and blood vessels. These pictures can show signs of PH or a condition that may be causing PH. Chest MRI. Chest magnetic resonance imaging, or chest MRI, shows how your right ventricle is working. The test also shows blood flow in your lungs. Chest MRI also can help detect signs of PH or an underlying condition causing PH. Lung function tests. Lung function tests measure how much air you can breathe in and out, how fast you can breathe air out, and how well your lungs deliver oxygen to your blood. These tests can help detect a lung disease that may be causing PH. Polysomnogram (PSG). This test records brain activity, eye movements, heart rate, and blood pressure while you sleep. A PSG also measures the level of oxygen in your blood. A low oxygen level during sleep is common in PH, and it can make the condition worse. A PSG usually is done while you stay overnight at a sleep center. For more information about this test, go to the Diseases and Conditions Index Sleep Studies article. Lung ventilation/perfusion (VQ) scan. A lung VQ scan measures air and blood flow in your lungs. This test can help detect blood clots in your lung's blood vessels. Blood tests. Blood tests are used to rule out other diseases, such as HIV, liver disease, and autoimmune diseases (such as rheumatoid arthritis). Finding Out the Severity of Pulmonary Hypertension Exercise testing is used to find out the severity of PH. This testing consists of either a 6-minute walk test or a cardiopulmonary exercise test. A 6-minute walk test measures the distance you can quickly walk in 6 minutes. A cardiopulmonary exercise test measures how well your lungs and heart work while you exercise on a treadmill or bicycle. During exercise testing, your doctor will rate your activity level. Your level is linked to the severity of your PH. The rating system ranges from class 1 to class 4. Class 1 has no limits. You can do regular physical activities, such as walking or climbing stairs. These activities don't cause PH symptoms, such as tiredness, shortness of breath, or chest pain. Class 2 has slight or mild limits. You're comfortable while resting, but regular physical activity causes PH symptoms. Class 3 has marked or noticeable limits. You're comfortable while resting. However, walking even one or two blocks or climbing one flight of stairs can cause PH symptoms. Class 4 has severe limits. You're not able to do any physical activity without discomfort. You also may have PH symptoms while at rest. Over time, you may need more exercise tests to find out how well your treatments are working. Each time testing is done, your doctor will compare your activity level with the previous one. Treatment Pulmonary hypertension (PH) has no cure. However, treatment may help relieve symptoms and slow the progress of the disease. PH is treated with medicines, procedures, and other therapies. Treatment will depend on what type of PH you have and its severity. (For more information, go to \"Types of Pulmonary Hypertension.\") Group 1 Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension Group 1 pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) includes PH that's inherited, that has no known cause, or that's caused by certain drugs or conditions. Treatments for group 1 PAH include medicines and medical procedures. Medicines Your doctor may prescribe medicines to relax the blood vessels in your lungs and reduce excess cell growth in the blood vessels. As the blood vessels relax, more blood can flow through them. Your doctor may prescribe medicines that are taken by mouth, inhaled, or injected. Examples of medicines for group 1 PAH include: Phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors, such as sildenafil Prostanoids, such as epoprostenol Endothelin receptor antagonists, such as bosentan and ambrisentan Calcium channel blockers, such as diltiazem Your doctor may prescribe one or more of these medicines. To find out which of these medicines works best, you'll likely have an acute vasoreactivity test. This test shows how the pressure in your pulmonary arteries reacts to certain medicines. The test is done during right heart catheterization. Medical and Surgical Procedures If you have group 1 PAH, your doctor may recommend one or more of the following procedures. Atrial septostomy (sep-TOS-toe-me). For this procedure, a thin, flexible tube called a catheter is put into a blood vessel in your leg and threaded to your heart. The tube is then put through the wall that separates your right and left atria (the upper chambers of your heart). This wall is called the septum. A tiny balloon on the tip of the tube is inflated. This creates an opening between the atria. This procedure relieves the pressure in the right atria and increases blood flow. Atrial septostomy is rarely done in the United States. Lung transplant. A lung transplant is surgery to replace a person's diseased lung with a healthy lung from a deceased donor. This procedure may be used for people who have severe lung disease that's causing PAH. Heart\u2013lung transplant. A heart\u2013lung transplant is surgery in which both the heart and lung are replaced with healthy organs from a deceased donor. Group 2 Pulmonary Hypertension Conditions that affect the left side of the heart, such as mitral valve disease, can cause group 2 PH. Treating the underlying condition will help treat PH. Treatments may include lifestyle changes, medicines, and surgery. Group 3 Pulmonary Hypertension Lung diseases, such as COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) and interstitial lung disease, can cause group 3 PH. Certain sleep disorders, such as sleep apnea, also can cause group 3 PH. If you have this type of PH, you may need oxygen therapy. This treatment raises the level of oxygen in your blood. You'll likely get the oxygen through soft, plastic prongs that fit into your nose. Oxygen therapy can be done at home or in a hospital. Your doctor also may recommend other treatments if you have an underlying lung disease. Group 4 Pulmonary Hypertension Blood clots in the lungs or blood clotting disorders can cause group 4 PH. If you have this type of PH, your doctor will likely prescribe blood-thinning medicines. These medicines prevent clots from forming or getting larger. Sometimes doctors use surgery to remove scarring in the pulmonary arteries due to old blood clots. Group 5 Pulmonary Hypertension Various diseases and conditions, such as thyroid disease and sarcoidosis, can cause group 5 PH. An object, such as a tumor, pressing on the pulmonary arteries also can cause group 5 PH. Group 5 PH is treated by treating its cause. All Types of Pulmonary Hypertension Several treatments may be used for all types of PH. These treatments include: Diuretics, also called water pills. These medicines help reduce fluid buildup in your body, including swelling in your ankles and feet. Blood-thinning medicines. These medicines help prevent blood clots from forming or getting larger. Digoxin. This medicine helps the heart beat stronger and pump more blood. Digoxin sometimes is used to control the heart rate if abnormal heart rhythms, such as atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter, occur. Oxygen therapy. This treatment raises the level of oxygen in your blood. Physical activity. Regular activity may help improve your ability to be active. Talk with your doctor about a physical activity plan that's safe for you. Research is ongoing for better PH treatments. These treatments offer hope for the future. Living With Pulmonary hypertension (PH) has no cure. However, you can work with your doctor to manage your symptoms and slow the progress of the disease.

This may be a sign that your PH is worsening. Pregnancy is risky for women who have PH. Consider using birth control if there is a chance you may become pregnant. Ask your doctor which birth control methods are safe for you. Lifestyle Changes Making lifestyle changes can help you manage your symptoms. These changes will depend on the type of PH you have. Talk with your doctor about which lifestyle changes can help you. Quit Smoking If you smoke, quit. Smoking makes PH symptoms worse. Ask your doctor about programs and products that can help you quit.

Follow a Healthy Diet Following a healthy diet and maintaining a healthy weight are part of a healthy lifestyle. A healthy diet includes a variety of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. It also includes lean meats, poultry, fish, and fat-free or low-fat milk or milk products. A healthy diet also is low in saturated fat, trans fat, cholesterol, sodium (salt), and added sugar. Talk with your doctor about whether you need to limit the amount of salt and fluids in your diet. Ask him or her whether you also need to regulate foods that contain vitamin K. These foods can affect how well blood-thinning medicines work. Vitamin K is found in green leafy vegetables and some oils, such as canola and soybean oil. For more information about following a healthy diet, go to the NHLBI's Aim for a Healthy Weight Web site, \"Your Guide to a Healthy Heart,\" and \"Your Guide to Lowering Your Blood Pressure With DASH.\" All of these resources include general advice about healthy eating. The DASH eating plan focuses on reduced-sodium foods, which may be helpful if your doctor advises you to limit the salt in your diet. Be Physically Active Physical activity is an important part of a healthy lifestyle. Try to do physical activity, such as walking, regularly. This will keep your muscles strong and help you stay active. Ask your doctor how much activity is safe for you. Your doctor may tell you to limit or avoid certain activities, such as: Those that cause straining, such as lifting heavy objects or weights. Sitting in a hot tub or sauna or taking long baths.

        "article": " Fibromyalgia Overview Fibromyalgia is a disorder characterized by widespread musculoskeletal pain accompanied by fatigue, sleep, memory and mood issues. Researchers believe that fibromyalgia amplifies painful sensations by affecting the way your brain processes pain signals. Symptoms sometimes begin after a physical trauma, surgery, infection or significant psychological stress. In other cases, symptoms gradually accumulate over time with no single triggering event. Women are more likely to develop fibromyalgia than are men. Many people who have fibromyalgia also have tension headaches, temporomandibular joint (TMJ) disorders, irritable bowel syndrome, anxiety and depression. While there is no cure for fibromyalgia, a variety of medications can help control symptoms. Exercise, relaxation and stress-reduction measures also may help. Symptoms Symptoms of fibromyalgia include: - Widespread pain. The pain associated with fibromyalgia often is described as a constant dull ache that has lasted for at least three months. To be considered widespread, the pain must occur on both sides of your body and above and below your waist. - Fatigue. People with fibromyalgia often awaken tired, even though they report sleeping for long periods of time. Sleep is often disrupted by pain, and many patients with fibromyalgia have other sleep disorders, such as restless legs syndrome and sleep apnea. - Cognitive difficulties. A symptom commonly referred to as \"fibro fog\" impairs the ability to focus, pay attention and concentrate on mental tasks. Fibromyalgia often co-exists with other painful conditions, such as: - Irritable bowel syndrome - Migraine and other types of headaches - Interstitial cystitis or painful bladder syndrome - Temporomandibular joint disorders Causes Doctors don't know what causes fibromyalgia, but it most likely involves a variety of factors working together. These may include: - Genetics. Because fibromyalgia tends to run in families, there may be certain genetic mutations that may make you more susceptible to developing the disorder. - Infections. Some illnesses appear to trigger or aggravate fibromyalgia. - Physical or emotional trauma. Fibromyalgia can sometimes be triggered by a physical trauma, such as a car accident. Psychological stress may also trigger the condition. Why does it hurt? Researchers believe repeated nerve stimulation causes the brains of people with fibromyalgia to change. This change involves an abnormal increase in levels of certain chemicals in the brain that signal pain (neurotransmitters). In addition, the brain's pain receptors seem to develop a sort of memory of the pain and become more sensitive, meaning they can overreact to pain signals. Risk factors Risk factors for fibromyalgia include: - Your sex. Fibromyalgia is diagnosed more often in women than in men. - Family history. You may be more likely to develop fibromyalgia if a relative also has the condition. - Other disorders. If you have osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis or lupus, you may be more likely to develop fibromyalgia. Diagnosis In the past, doctors would check 18 specific points on a person's body to see how many of them were painful when pressed firmly. Newer guidelines don't require a tender point exam. Instead, a fibromyalgia diagnosis can be made if a person has had widespread pain for more than three months - with no underlying medical condition that could cause the pain. Blood tests While there is no lab test to confirm a diagnosis of fibromyalgia, your doctor may want to rule out other conditions that may have similar symptoms. Blood tests may include: - Complete blood count - Erythrocyte sedimentation rate - Cyclic citrullinated peptide test - Rheumatoid factor - Thyroid function tests Treatment In general, treatments for fibromyalgia include both medication and self-care. The emphasis is on minimizing symptoms and improving general health. No one treatment works for all symptoms. Medications Medications can help reduce the pain of fibromyalgia and improve sleep.

Psychological stress may also trigger the condition. Why does it hurt? Researchers believe repeated nerve stimulation causes the brains of people with fibromyalgia to change. This change involves an abnormal increase in levels of certain chemicals in the brain that signal pain (neurotransmitters). In addition, the brain's pain receptors seem to develop a sort of memory of the pain and become more sensitive, meaning they can overreact to pain signals. Risk factors Risk factors for fibromyalgia include: - Your sex. Fibromyalgia is diagnosed more often in women than in men. - Family history. You may be more likely to develop fibromyalgia if a relative also has the condition. - Other disorders. If you have osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis or lupus, you may be more likely to develop fibromyalgia. Diagnosis In the past, doctors would check 18 specific points on a person's body to see how many of them were painful when pressed firmly. Newer guidelines don't require a tender point exam. Instead, a fibromyalgia diagnosis can be made if a person has had widespread pain for more than three months - with no underlying medical condition that could cause the pain. Blood tests While there is no lab test to confirm a diagnosis of fibromyalgia, your doctor may want to rule out other conditions that may have similar symptoms. Blood tests may include: - Complete blood count - Erythrocyte sedimentation rate - Cyclic citrullinated peptide test - Rheumatoid factor - Thyroid function tests Treatment In general, treatments for fibromyalgia include both medication and self-care. The emphasis is on minimizing symptoms and improving general health. No one treatment works for all symptoms. Medications Medications can help reduce the pain of fibromyalgia and improve sleep. Common choices include: - Pain relievers. Over-the-counter pain relievers such as acetaminophen (Tylenol, others), ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, others) or naproxen sodium (Aleve, others) may be helpful. Your doctor might suggest a prescription pain reliever such as tramadol (Ultram). Narcotics are not advised, because they can lead to dependence and may even worsen the pain over time. - Antidepressants. Duloxetine (Cymbalta) and milnacipran (Savella) may help ease the pain and fatigue associated with fibromyalgia. Your doctor may prescribe amitriptyline or the muscle relaxant cyclobenzaprine to help promote sleep. - Anti-seizure drugs. Medications designed to treat epilepsy are often useful in reducing certain types of pain. Gabapentin (Neurontin) is sometimes helpful in reducing fibromyalgia symptoms, while pregabalin (Lyrica) was the first drug approved by the Food and Drug Administration to treat fibromyalgia. Therapy A variety of different therapies can help reduce the effect that fibromyalgia has on your body and your life. Examples include: - Physical therapy. A physical therapist can teach you exercises that will improve your strength, flexibility and stamina. Water-based exercises might be particularly helpful. - Occupational therapy. An occupational therapist can help you make adjustments to your work area or the way you perform certain tasks that will cause less stress on your body. - Counseling. Talking with a counselor can help strengthen your belief in your abilities and teach you strategies for dealing with stressful situations. Lifestyle and home remedies Self-care is critical in the management of fibromyalgia. - Reduce stress. Develop a plan to avoid or limit overexertion and emotional stress. Allow yourself time each day to relax. That may mean learning how to say no without guilt. But try not to change your routine completely. People who quit work or drop all activity tend to do worse than do those who remain active. Try stress management techniques, such as deep-breathing exercises or meditation. - Get enough sleep. Because fatigue is one of the main characteristics of fibromyalgia, getting sufficient sleep is essential. In addition to allotting enough time for sleep, practice good sleep habits, such as going to bed and getting up at the same time each day and limiting daytime napping. - Exercise regularly. At first, exercise may increase your pain. But doing it gradually and regularly often decreases symptoms. Appropriate exercises may include walking, swimming, biking and water aerobics. A physical therapist can help you develop a home exercise program. Stretching, good posture and relaxation exercises also are helpful. - Pace yourself. Keep your activity on an even level. If you do too much on your good days, you may have more bad days. Moderation means not overdoing it on your good days, but likewise it means not self-limiting or doing too little on the days when symptoms flare. - Maintain a healthy lifestyle. Eat healthy foods. Limit your caffeine intake. Do something that you find enjoyable and fulfilling every day. Alternative medicine Complementary and alternative therapies for pain and stress management aren't new. Some, such as meditation and yoga, have been practiced for thousands of years. But their use has become more popular in recent years, especially with people who have chronic illnesses, such as fibromyalgia. Several of these treatments do appear to safely relieve stress and reduce pain, and some are gaining acceptance in mainstream medicine. But many practices remain unproved because they haven't been adequately studied. - Acupuncture. Acupuncture is a Chinese medical system based on restoring normal balance of life forces by inserting very fine needles through the skin to various depths. According to Western theories of acupuncture, the needles cause changes in blood flow and levels of neurotransmitters in the brain and spinal cord. Some studies indicate that acupuncture helps relieve fibromyalgia symptoms, while others show no benefit. - Massage therapy. This is one of the oldest methods of health care still in practice. It involves use of different manipulative techniques to move your body's muscles and soft tissues. Massage can reduce your heart rate, relax your muscles, improve range of motion in your joints and increase production of your body's natural painkillers. It often helps relieve stress and anxiety. - Yoga and tai chi. These practices combine meditation, slow movements, deep breathing and relaxation. Both have been found to be helpful in controlling fibromyalgia symptoms. ",

A fractured nose is the most common fracture of the face. It most often occurs after an injury and often occurs with other fractures of the face.   Nose injuries and neck injuries are often seen together. A blow that is forceful enough to injure the nose may be hard enough to injure the neck.   Serious nose injuries cause problems that need a health care provider's attention right away. For example, damage to the cartilage can cause a collection of blood to form inside the nose. If this blood is not drained right away, it can cause an abscess or a permanent deformity that blocks the nose. It may lead to tissue death and cause the nose to collapse.   For minor nose injuries, the provider may want to see the person within the first week after the injury to see if the nose has moved out of its normal shape.   Sometimes, surgery may be needed to correct a nose or septum that has been bent out of shape by an injury. Symptoms may include:     - Blood coming from the nose   - Bruising around the eyes   - Difficulty breathing through the nose   - Misshapen appearance (may not be obvious until the swelling goes down)   - Pain   - Swelling     The bruised appearance most often disappears after 2 weeks. If a nose injury happens:     - Try to stay calm.   - Breathe through your mouth and lean forward in a sitting position to keep blood from going down the back of your throat.   - Squeeze the nostrils closed and hold pressure to stop the bleeding.   - Apply cold compresses to your nose to reduce swelling.

        "section": "Broken nose: A broken nose, also called a nasal fracture, is a break or crack in a bone in your nose - often the bone over the bridge of your nose. Common causes of a broken nose include contact sports, physical fights, falls and motor vehicle accidents that result in facial trauma. A broken nose can cause pain, along with swelling and bruising around your nose and under your eyes. Your nose may look crooked, and you may have trouble breathing. Treatment for a broken nose may include procedures that realign your nose. Surgery usually isn't necessary for a broken nose. Signs and symptoms of a broken nose: - Pain or tenderness, especially when touching your nose   - Swelling of your nose and surrounding areas   - Bleeding from your nose   - Bruising around your nose or eyes   - Crooked or misshapen nose   - Difficulty breathing through your nose   - Discharge of mucus from your nose   - Feeling that one or both of your nasal passages are blocked When to see a doctor Seek emergency medical attention if you experience a nose injury accompanied by: - A head or neck injury, which may be marked by severe headache, neck pain, vomiting or loss of consciousness   - Difficulty breathing   - Bleeding you can't stop   - A noticeable change in the shape of your nose that isn't related to swelling, such as a crooked or twisted appearance   - Clear, watery fluid draining from your nose Common causes of a broken nose include: - Injury from contact sports, such as football or hockey   - Physical altercations   - Motor vehicle accidents   - Falls A broken nose can even be caused by walking into a fixed object, such as a door or wall, or by rough, wrestling-type play. Any activity that increases your risk of a facial injury increases your risk of a broken nose. Such activities may include: - Playing contact sports, such as football and hockey, especially without a helmet that has a face mask   - Engaging in a physical fight   - Riding a bicycle   - Lifting weights, especially if you don't use a spotter   - Riding in a motor vehicle, especially without a seat belt Complications or injuries related to a broken nose may include: - Deviated septum. A nose fracture may cause a deviated septum, a condition that occurs when the thin wall dividing the two sides of your nose (nasal septum) is displaced, narrowing your nasal passage. Medications, such as decongestants and antihistamines, can help you manage a deviated septum, but surgery is required to correct the condition.   - Collection of blood. Sometimes, pools of clotted blood form in a broken nose, creating a condition called a septal hematoma. A septal hematoma can block one or both nostrils. Septal hematoma requires prompt surgical drainage to prevent cartilage damage.   - Cartilage fracture. If your fracture is due to a forceful blow, such as from an automobile accident, you also may experience a cartilage fracture. If your injury is severe enough to warrant surgical treatment, the surgeon should address both your bone and cartilage injuries.   - Neck injury. Likewise, nose fractures resulting from high-velocity injuries - like those experienced in motor vehicle accidents - may be accompanied by injuries to your neck. If a blow is strong enough to break your nose, it may also be strong enough to damage the bones in your neck. If you suspect a neck injury, see your doctor immediately. Your doctor may press gently on the outside of your nose and its surrounding areas. He or she may look inside your nasal passage to check for obstruction and further signs of broken bones. Your doctor may use anesthetics - either a nasal spray or local injections - to make you more comfortable during the exam. X-rays and other imaging studies are usually unnecessary. However, your doctor may recommend a computerized tomography (CT) scan if the severity of your injuries makes a thorough physical exam impossible or if your doctor suspects you may have other injuries. If you have a minor fracture that hasn't caused your nose to become crooked or otherwise misshapen, you may not need professional medical treatment. Your doctor may recommend simple self-care measures, such as using ice on the area and taking over-the-counter pain medications. Fixing displacements and breaks Your doctor may be able to realign your nose manually, or you may need surgery. Manual realignment If the break has displaced the bones and cartilage in your nose, your doctor may be able to manually realign them. This needs to be done within 14 days from when the fracture occurred, preferably sooner. During this procedure, your doctor: - Administers medication by injection or nasal spray to ease discomfort - Opens your nostrils with a nasal speculum - Uses special instruments to help realign your broken bones and cartilage Your doctor will also splint your nose using packing in your nose and a dressing on the outside. Sometimes, an internal splint is also necessary for a short time. The packing usually needs to stay in for a week. You'll also be given a prescription for antibiotics to prevent infection with the bacteria that may normally reside in your nose. Surgery Severe breaks, multiple breaks or breaks that have gone untreated for more than 14 days may not be candidates for manual realignment. In these cases, surgery to realign the bones and reshape your nose may be necessary. If the break has damaged your nasal septum, causing obstruction or difficulty breathing, reconstructive surgery may be recommended. Surgery is typically performed on an outpatient basis. If you think you may have broken your nose, take these steps to reduce pain and swelling before seeing your doctor: - Act quickly. When the break first occurs, breathe through your mouth and lean forward to reduce the amount of blood that drains into your throat. - Use ice. Apply ice packs or cold compresses immediately after the injury, and then at least four times a day for the first 24 to 48 hours to reduce swelling. Keep the ice or cold compress on for 10 to 15 minutes at a time. Wrap the ice in a washcloth to prevent frostbite. Try not to apply too much pressure, which can cause additional pain or damage to your nose. - Relieve pain. Take over-the-counter pain relievers, such as acetaminophen (Tylenol, others), ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, others) or naproxen sodium (Aleve, others), as necessary. - Keep your head up. Elevate your head - especially when sleeping - so as not to worsen swelling and throbbing. - Limit your activities. For the first two weeks after treatment, don't play any sports. Avoid contact sports for at least six weeks after your injury.",

Rhinoplasty can be performed under local or general anesthesia, depending on the exact procedure and the person's preference. It is performed in a surgeon's office, a hospital, or an outpatient surgery center. Complex procedures may require a short hospital stay. The procedure often takes 1 to 2 hours. It may take longer.   With local anesthesia, the nose and the area around it are numbed. You will probably be lightly sedated, but awake during the surgery (relaxed and not feeling pain). General anesthesia allows you to sleep through the operation.   The surgery is usually done through a cut (incision) made inside the nostrils. In some cases, the cut is made from outside, around the base of the nose. This type of cut is used to perform work on the tip of the nose or if you need a cartilage graft. If the nose needs to be narrowed, the incision may extend around the nostrils. Small incisions may be made on the side of the nose to break, and reshape the bone.   A splint (metal or plastic) may be placed on the outside of the nose. This helps maintain the new shape of the bone when the surgery is finished.

Your surgeon may give you instructions to follow before your surgery. You may need to:     - Stop any medicines that thin your blood. Your surgeon will give you a list of these medicines.   - See your regular health care provider to have some routine tests and make sure it is safe for you to have surgery.   - To aid with healing, stop smoking 2 to 3 weeks before and after surgery.   - Arrange to have someone drive you home after surgery. You will usually go home on the same day as your surgery.   Right after surgery, your nose and face will be swollen and painful. Headaches are common.   The nasal packing is usually removed in 3 to 5 days, after which you will feel more comfortable.   The splint may be left in place for 1 to 2 weeks. Full recovery takes several weeks.

After the Procedure You will usually go home on the same day as your surgery. Right after surgery, your nose and face will be swollen and painful. Headaches are common. The nasal packing is usually removed in 3 to 5 days, after which you will feel more comfortable. The splint may be left in place for 1 to 2 weeks. Outlook (Prognosis) Full recovery takes several weeks. Healing is a slow and gradual process. The tip of the nose may have some swelling and numbness for months. You may not be able to see the final results for up to a year. Review Date 1/10/2017 Updated by: David A.

        "article": " Uterine prolapse Overview Uterine prolapse occurs when pelvic floor muscles and ligaments stretch and weaken and no longer provide enough support for the uterus. As a result, the uterus slips down into or protrudes out of the vagina. Uterine prolapse can occur in women of any age. But it often affects postmenopausal women who've had one or more vaginal deliveries. Mild uterine prolapse usually doesn't require treatment. But if uterine prolapse makes you uncomfortable or disrupts your normal life, you might benefit from treatment. Uterine prolapse care at Mayo Clinic Symptoms Mild uterine prolapse generally doesn't cause signs or symptoms. Signs and symptoms of moderate to severe uterine prolapse include: - Sensation of heaviness or pulling in your pelvis - Tissue protruding from your vagina - Urinary problems, such as urine leakage (incontinence) or urine retention - Trouble having a bowel movement - Feeling as if you're sitting on a small ball or as if something is falling out of your vagina - Sexual concerns, such as a sensation of looseness in the tone of your vaginal tissue Often, symptoms are less bothersome in the morning and worsen as the day goes on. See your doctor to discuss your options if signs and symptoms of uterine prolapse become bothersome and disrupt your normal activities. Causes Uterine prolapse results from the weakening of pelvic muscles and supportive tissues. Causes of weakened pelvic muscles and tissues include: - Pregnancy - Difficult labor and delivery or trauma during childbirth - Delivery of a large baby - Being overweight or obese - Lower estrogen level after menopause - Chronic constipation or straining with bowel movements - Chronic cough or bronchitis - Repeated heavy lifting Risk factors Factors that can increase your risk of uterine prolapse include: - One or more pregnancies and vaginal births - Giving birth to a large baby - Increasing age - Obesity - Prior pelvic surgery - Chronic constipation or frequent straining during bowel movements - Family history of weakness in connective tissue - Being Hispanic or white Complications Uterine prolapse is often associated with prolapse of other pelvic organs. You might experience: - Anterior prolapse (cystocele). Weakness of connective tissue separating the bladder and vagina may cause the bladder to bulge into the vagina. Anterior prolapse is also called prolapsed bladder. - Posterior vaginal prolapse (rectocele). Weakness of connective tissue separating the rectum and vagina may cause the rectum to bulge into the vagina. You might have difficulty having bowel movements. Severe uterine prolapse can displace part of the vaginal lining, causing it to protrude outside the body. Vaginal tissue that rubs against clothing can lead to vaginal sores (ulcers.) Rarely, the sores can become infected. Diagnosis A diagnosis of uterine prolapse generally occurs during a pelvic exam. During the pelvic exam your doctor is likely to ask you: - To bear down as if having a bowel movement. Bearing down can help your doctor assess how far the uterus has slipped into the vagina. - To tighten your pelvic muscles as if you're stopping a stream of urine. This test checks the strength of your pelvic muscles. You might fill out a questionnaire that helps your doctor assess how uterine prolapse affects your quality of life. This information helps guide treatment decisions. If you have severe incontinence, your doctor might recommend tests to measure how well your bladder functions (urodynamic testing). Treatment Treatment depends on the severity of uterine prolapse. Your doctor might recommend: - Self-care measures. If your uterine prolapse causes few or no symptoms, simple self-care measures may provide relief or help prevent worsening prolapse. Self-care measures include performing Kegel exercises to strengthen your pelvic muscles, losing weight and treating constipation. - Pessary. A vaginal pessary is a plastic or rubber ring inserted into your vagina to support the bulging tissues. A pessary must be removed regularly for cleaning. Surgery If uterine prolapse is severe, your doctor might recommend surgery. Minimally invasive (laparoscopic) or vaginal surgery might be an option. Surgery can involve: - Repair of weakened pelvic floor tissues. This surgery is generally approached through the vagina but sometimes through the abdomen. The surgeon might graft your own tissue, donor tissue or a synthetic material onto weakened pelvic floor structures to support your pelvic organs. - Removal of your uterus (hysterectomy). Hysterectomy might be recommended if uterine prolapse is severe. But hysterectomy is major surgery, and recent research suggests the surgery poses long-term health risks, including an increased risk of heart and blood vessel (cardiovascular) diseases and certain metabolic conditions. Talk with your doctor about all your treatment options to be sure you understand the risks and benefits of each so that you can choose what's best for you. Lifestyle and home remedies Depending on the severity of your uterine prolapse, self-care measures may provide relief. Try to: - Perform Kegel exercises to strengthen pelvic muscles and support the weakened fascia - Avoid constipation by eating high-fiber foods and drinking plenty of fluids - Avoid bearing down to move your bowels - Avoid heavy lifting - Control coughing - Lose weight if you're overweight or obese Kegel exercises strengthen your pelvic floor muscles. A strong pelvic floor provides better support for your pelvic organs, prevents prolapse from worsening and relieves symptoms associated with uterine prolapse. To perform Kegel exercises: - Tighten (contract) your pelvic floor muscles as though you were trying to prevent passing gas. - Hold the contraction for five seconds, and then relax for five seconds. If this is too difficult, start by holding for two seconds and relaxing for three seconds. - Work up to holding the contractions for 10 seconds at a time. - Aim for at least three sets of 10 repetitions each day. Kegel exercises may be most successful when they're taught by a physical therapist and reinforced with biofeedback. Biofeedback involves using monitoring devices that help ensure you're tightening the muscles properly for the best length of time. Once you've learned the proper method, you can do Kegel exercises discreetly just about anytime, whether you're sitting at your desk or relaxing on the couch. ",

        "article": " Anterior prolapse (cystocele) Overview Anterior prolapse, also known as a cystocele (SIS-toe-seel), occurs when the supportive tissue between a woman's bladder and vaginal wall weakens and stretches, allowing the bladder to bulge into the vagina. Anterior prolapse is also called a prolapsed bladder. Straining the muscles that support your pelvic organs may lead to anterior prolapse. Such straining occurs during vaginal childbirth or with chronic constipation, violent coughing or heavy lifting. Anterior prolapse also tends to cause problems after menopause, when estrogen levels decrease. For a mild or moderate anterior prolapse, nonsurgical treatment is often effective. In more severe cases, surgery may be necessary to keep the vagina and other pelvic organs in their proper positions. Symptoms In mild cases of anterior prolapse, you may not notice any signs or symptoms. When signs and symptoms occur, they may include: - A feeling of fullness or pressure in your pelvis and vagina - Increased discomfort when you strain, cough, bear down or lift - A feeling that you haven't completely emptied your bladder after urinating - Repeated bladder infections - Pain or urinary leakage during sexual intercourse - In severe cases, a bulge of tissue that protrudes through your vaginal opening and may feel like sitting on an egg Signs and symptoms often are especially noticeable after standing for long periods of time and may go away when you lie down. When to see a doctor A severely prolapsed bladder can be uncomfortable. It can make emptying your bladder difficult and may lead to bladder infections. Make an appointment with your doctor if you have any signs or symptoms that bother you. Causes Your pelvic floor consists of muscles, ligaments and connective tissues that support your bladder and other pelvic organs. The connections between your pelvic floor muscles and ligaments can weaken over time, as a result of trauma from childbirth or chronic straining of pelvic floor muscles. When this happens, your bladder can slip down lower than normal and bulge into your vagina (anterior prolapse). Possible causes of anterior prolapse include: - Pregnancy and vaginal childbirth - Being overweight or obese - Repeated heavy lifting - Straining with bowel movements - A chronic cough or bronchitis Risk factors These factors may increase your risk of anterior prolapse: - Childbirth. Women who have vaginally delivered one or more children have a higher risk of anterior prolapse. - Aging. Your risk of anterior prolapse increases as you age. This is especially true after menopause, when your body's production of estrogen - which helps keep the pelvic floor strong - decreases. - Hysterectomy. Having your uterus removed may contribute to weakness in your pelvic floor support. - Genetics. Some women are born with weaker connective tissues, making them more susceptible to anterior prolapse. - Obesity. Women who are overweight or obese are at higher risk of anterior prolapse. Diagnosis Diagnosis of anterior prolapse may involve: - A pelvic exam. You may be examined while lying down and while standing up. During the exam, your doctor looks for a tissue bulge into your vagina that indicates pelvic organ prolapse. You'll likely be asked to bear down as if during a bowel movement to see how much that affects the degree of prolapse. To check the strength of your pelvic floor muscles, you'll be asked to contract them, as if you're trying to stop the stream of urine. - Filling out a questionnaire. You may fill out a form that helps your doctor assess the degree of your prolapse and how much it affects your quality of life. Information gathered also helps guide treatment decisions. - Bladder and urine tests. If you have significant prolapse, you might be tested to see how well and completely your bladder empties. Your doctor might also run a test on a urine sample to look for signs of a bladder infection, if it seems that you're retaining more urine in your bladder than is normal after urinating. Treatment Treatment depends on how severe your anterior prolapse is and whether you have any related conditions, such as a uterus that slips into the vaginal canal (uterine prolapse). Mild cases - those with few or no obvious symptoms - typically don't require treatment. You could opt for a wait-and-see approach, with occasional visits to your doctor to see if your prolapse is worsening, along with self-care measures, such as exercises that strengthen your pelvic floor muscles. If self-care measures aren't effective, anterior prolapse treatment might involve: - A supportive device (pessary). A vaginal pessary is a plastic or rubber ring inserted into your vagina to support the bladder. Your doctor or other care provider fits you for the device and shows you how to clean and reinsert it on your own. Many women use pessaries as a temporary alternative to surgery, and some use them when surgery is too risky. - Estrogen therapy. Your doctor may recommend using estrogen - usually a vaginal cream, pill or ring - especially if you've already experienced menopause. This is because estrogen, which helps keep pelvic muscles strong, decreases after menopause. When surgery is necessary If you have noticeable, uncomfortable symptoms, anterior prolapse may require surgery. - How it's done. Often, the surgery is performed vaginally and involves lifting the prolapsed bladder back into place, removing extra tissue, and tightening the muscles and ligaments of the pelvic floor. Your doctor may use a special type of tissue graft to reinforce vaginal tissues and increase support if your vaginal tissues seem very thin. - If you have a prolapsed uterus. For anterior prolapse associated with a prolapsed uterus, your doctor may recommend removing the uterus (hysterectomy) in addition to repairing the damaged pelvic floor muscles, ligaments and other tissues. If you're thinking about becoming pregnant, your doctor may recommend that you delay surgery until after you're done having children. Using a pessary may help relieve your symptoms in the meantime. The benefits of surgery can last for many years, but there's some risk of recurrence - which may mean another surgery at some point. Dealing with incontinence If your anterior prolapse is accompanied by stress incontinence - involuntary loss of urine during strenuous activity - your doctor may recommend one of a number of procedures to support the urethra (urethral suspension) and ease your incontinence symptoms. Treatment at Mayo Clinic Urologists and urogynecologists at Mayo Clinic provide expert care for female patients of all ages who suffer from problems of the pelvic floor. Mayo physicians are leaders in clinical research that enhances the capability to offer the most advanced treatments available. Many of the urologists across all Mayo Clinic campuses have advanced training and subspecialty certification in female pelvic medicine and reconstructive surgery from the American Board of Urology. Urogynecologists at Mayo Clinic also have advanced training and certification in female urology. Specialty services offered through urology and urogynecology include: - Pelvic organ prolapse with or without incontinence diagnosis and treatment - Urodynamic evaluation - Stress urinary incontinence diagnosis and treatment - Minimally invasive injection therapies - Management of mesh complications - Urge urinary incontinence diagnosis and treatment - Overactive bladder diagnosis and treatment - Botox injections of the urinary tract - Neuromodulation for the urinary tract Lifestyle and home remedies Kegel exercises strengthen your pelvic floor muscles, which support the uterus, bladder and bowel. A strengthened pelvic floor provides better support for your pelvic organs and relief from symptoms associated with anterior prolapse. To perform Kegel exercises, follow these steps: - Tighten (contract) your pelvic floor muscles - the muscles you use to stop urinating. - Hold the contraction for five seconds, then relax for five seconds. (If this is too difficult, start by holding for two seconds and relaxing for three seconds.) - Work up to holding the contraction for 10 seconds at a time. - Do three sets of 10 repetitions of the exercises each day. Ask your health care provider for feedback on whether you're using the right muscles. Kegel exercises may be most successful when they're taught by a physical therapist and reinforced with biofeedback. Biofeedback involves using monitoring devices that help ensure you're tightening the proper muscles with optimal intensity and length of time. Once you've learned the proper method, you can do Kegel exercises discreetly just about anytime, whether you're sitting at your desk or relaxing on the couch. ",

Description Surgery is done while you are under general anesthesia so you will be asleep and pain-free. To perform the surgery: The surgeon makes a 5 to 7 inch (12.5 to 17.5 centimeters) cut in the upper right part of your belly, just below your ribs. The area is opened up so the surgeon can view the gallbladder and separate it from the other organs. The surgeon cuts the bile duct and blood vessels that lead to the gallbladder. The gallbladder is gently lifted out and removed from your body. An x-ray called a cholangiogram may be done during your surgery. To do this test, dye is injected into your common bile duct and an x-ray is taken. The dye helps find stones that may be outside your gallbladder. If other stones are found, the surgeon may remove them with a special instrument. The surgery takes about 1 hour. Why the Procedure is Performed You may need this surgery if you have pain or other symptoms from gallstones. You may also need surgery if your gallbladder is not working normally. Common symptoms may include: Indigestion, including bloating, heartburn, and gas Nausea and vomiting Pain after eating, usually in the upper right or upper middle area of your belly (epigastric pain) The most common way to remove the gallbladder is by using a medical instrument called a laparoscope (laparoscopic cholecystectomy).

Other reasons for removing the gallbladder by open surgery: Unexpected bleeding during the laparoscopic operation Obesity Pancreatitis (inflammation in the pancreas) Pregnancy (third trimester) Severe liver problems Past surgeries in the same area of your belly Risks Risks of anesthesia and surgery in general are: Reactions to medicines Breathing problems Bleeding, blood clots Infection Risks of gallbladder surgery are: Damage to the blood vessels that go to the liver Injury to the common bile duct Injury to the small or large intestine Pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas) Before the Procedure Your may have the following tests done before surgery: Blood tests (complete blood count, electrolytes, liver and kidney tests) Chest x-ray or electrocardiogram (EKG), for some patients Several x-rays of the gallbladder Ultrasound of the gallbladder Tell your doctor or nurse: If you are or might be pregnant Which drugs, vitamins, and other supplements you are taking, even ones you bought without a prescription During the week before surgery: You may be asked to stop taking aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), vitamin E, warfarin (Coumadin), and any other drugs that put you at a higher risk of bleeding during surgery. Ask your doctor which drugs you should still take on the day of your surgery. Prepare your home for any problems you might have getting around after the surgery. You'll be told when to arrive at the hospital. On the day of surgery: Follow instructions about when to stop eating and drinking. Take the drugs your doctor told you to take with a small sip of water. Shower the night before or the morning of your surgery. Arrive at the hospital on time. After the Procedure You may need to stay in the hospital for 3 to 5 days after open gallbladder removal. During that time: You may be asked to breathe into a device called an incentive spirometer. This helps keep your lungs working well so that you do not get pneumonia. The nurse will help you sit up in bed, hang your legs over the side, and then stand up and start to walk. At first, you will receive fluids into your vein through an intravenous (IV) tube. Soon after, you will be asked to start drinking liquids and eating foods. You will be able to shower while you are still in the hospital. You may be asked to wear pressure stockings on your legs to help prevent a blood clot from forming. If there were problems during your surgery, or if you have bleeding, a lot of pain, or a fever, you may need to stay in the hospital longer. Your doctor or nurses will tell you how to care for yourself after you leave the hospital. Outlook (Prognosis) Most people recover quickly and have good results from this procedure.

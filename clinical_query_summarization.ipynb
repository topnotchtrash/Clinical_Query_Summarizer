Many\\u00a0individuals do well with no therapy at all, especially since many medications have serious side effects and some carry significant risks.\\u00a0 However, three forms of beta interferon (Avonex, Betaseron, and Rebif) have now been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for treatment of relapsing-remitting MS.\\u00a0 The FDA has also approved ocrelizumab (brand name Ocrevus) to treat adults with relapsing forms of MS and primary progressive MS. Beta interferon has been shown to reduce the number of exacerbations and may slow the progression of physical disability. When attacks do occur, they tend to be shorter and less severe.\\u00a0 The FDA also has approved a synthetic form of myelin basic protein, called copolymer I (Copaxone), for the treatment of relapsing-remitting MS. Copolymer I has few side effects, and studies indicate that the agent can reduce the relapse rate by almost one third. \\u00a0Other FDA approved drugs to treat relapsing forms of MS in adults include teriflunomide and dimethyl fumarate. \\u00a0An immunosuppressant treatment,Novantrone\\u00a0(mitoxantrone), is\\u00a0approved by the FDA for the treatment of advanced or chronic MS. \\u00a0The FDA has also approved dalfampridine (Ampyra) to improve walking in individuals with MS. One monoclonal antibody, natalizumab (Tysabri), was shown in clinical trials to significantly reduce the frequency of attacks in people with relapsing forms of MS and was approved for marketing by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2004.\\u00a0 In 2006, the FDA again approved sale of the drug for MS but under strict treatment guidelines involving infusion centers where patients can be monitored by specially trained physicians. \\u00a0While steroids do not affect the course of MS over time, they can reduce the duration and severity of attacks in some patients.\\u00a0 Spasticity, which can occur either as a sustained stiffness caused by increased muscle tone or as spasms that come and go, is usually treated with muscle relaxants and tranquilizers such as baclofen, tizanidine, diazepam, clonazepam, and dantrolene. Physical therapy and exercise can help preserve remaining function, and patients may find that various aids -- such as foot braces, canes, and walkers -- can help them remain independent and mobile.\\u00a0 Avoiding excessive activity and avoiding heat are probably the most important measures patients can take to counter physiological fatigue.\\u00a0 If psychological symptoms of fatigue such as depression or apathy are evident, antidepressant medications may help.\\u00a0 Other drugs that may reduce fatigue in some, but not all, patients include amantadine (Symmetrel), pemoline (Cylert), and the still-experimental drug aminopyridine. Although improvement of optic symptoms usually occurs even without treatment, a short course of treatment with intravenous methylprednisolone (Solu-Medrol) followed by treatment with oral steroids is sometimes used.  The vast majority of patients are mildly affected, but in the worst cases, MS can render a person unable to write, speak, or walk.\\u00a0 MS is a disease with a natural tendency to remit spontaneously, for which there is no universally effective treatment.\",\n          \"There is no cure for Tay-Sachs disease, but some treatments can help in managing symptoms.

You should seek the advice of at least two experts, and ask about the benefits and risks of the surgery. The following treatments have not been shown to keep curves from getting worse in scoliosis: - Chiropractic treatment. - Electrical stimulation. - Nutritional supplements.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Detailed Section\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 371,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Colon cancer (Treatment): The type of treatment your doctor recommends will depend largely on the stage of your cancer. The three primary treatment options are surgery, chemotherapy and radiation. Surgery for early-stage colon cancer If your colon cancer is very small, your doctor may recommend a minimally invasive approach to surgery, such as: - Removing polyps during a colonoscopy. If your cancer is small, localized and completely contained within a polyp and in a very early stage, your doctor may be able to remove it completely during a colonoscopy. - Endoscopic mucosal resection. Removing larger polyps may require also taking a small amount of the lining of the colon or rectum in a procedure called an endoscopic mucosal resection. - Minimally invasive surgery. Polyps that can't be removed during a colonoscopy may be removed using laparoscopic surgery. In this procedure, your surgeon performs the operation through several small incisions in your abdominal wall, inserting instruments with attached cameras that display your colon on a video monitor. The surgeon may also take samples from lymph nodes in the area where the cancer is located. Surgery for invasive colon cancer If the cancer has grown into or through your colon, your surgeon may recommend: - Partial colectomy. During this procedure, the surgeon removes the part of your colon that contains the cancer, along with a margin of normal tissue on either side of the cancer. Your surgeon is often able to reconnect the healthy portions of your colon or rectum. This procedure can commonly be done by a minimally invasive approach (laparoscopy). - Surgery to create a way for waste to leave your body. When it's not possible to reconnect the healthy portions of your colon or rectum, you may need an ostomy. This involves creating an opening in the wall of your abdomen from a portion of the remaining bowel for the elimination of stool into a bag that fits securely over the opening. Sometimes the ostomy is only temporary, allowing your colon or rectum time to heal after surgery. In some cases, however, the colostomy may be permanent. - Lymph node removal. Nearby lymph nodes are usually also removed during colon cancer surgery and tested for cancer. Surgery for advanced cancer If your cancer is very advanced or your overall health very poor, your surgeon may recommend an operation to relieve a blockage of your colon or other conditions in order to improve your symptoms. This surgery isn't done to cure cancer, but instead to relieve signs and symptoms, such as bleeding and pain. In specific cases where the cancer has spread only to the liver but your overall health is otherwise good, your doctor may recommend surgery to remove the cancerous lesion from your liver. Chemotherapy may be used before or after this type of surgery. This approach provides a chance to be free of cancer over the long term. Chemotherapy Chemotherapy uses drugs to destroy cancer cells. Chemotherapy for colon cancer is usually given after surgery if the cancer has spread to lymph nodes. In this way, chemotherapy may help reduce the risk of cancer recurrence and death from cancer. Sometimes chemotherapy may be used before surgery as well, with the goal of shrinking the cancer before an operation. Chemotherapy before surgery is more common in rectal cancer than in colon cancer. Chemotherapy can also be given to relieve symptoms of colon cancer that has spread to other areas of the body. Radiation therapy Radiation therapy uses powerful energy sources, such as X-rays, to kill cancer cells, to shrink large tumors before an operation so that they can be removed more easily, or to relieve symptoms of colon cancer and rectal cancer. Radiation therapy either alone or combined with chemotherapy is one of the standard treatment options for the initial management of rectal cancer followed by surgery. Targeted drug therapy Drugs that target specific malfunctions that allow cancer cells to grow are available to people with advanced colon cancer, including: - Bevacizumab (Avastin) - Cetuximab (Erbitux) - Panitumumab (Vectibix) - Ramucirumab (Cyramza) - Regorafenib (Stivarga) - Ziv-aflibercept (Zaltrap) Targeted drugs can be given along with chemotherapy or alone. Targeted drugs are typically reserved for people with advanced colon cancer. Some people are helped by targeted drugs, while others are not. Researchers have recently made progress in determining who is most likely to benefit from specific targeted drugs. Until more is known, doctors carefully weigh the possible benefit of targeted drugs against the risk of side effects and the cost when deciding whether to use these treatments. Immunotherapy Some patients with advanced colon cancer have a chance to benefit from immunotherapy with antibodies such as pembrolizumab (Keytruda) and nivolumab (Opdivo). Whether a colon cancer has the chance to respond to these immunotherapies can be determined by a specific test of the tumor tissue. Supportive (palliative) care Palliative care is specialized medical care that focuses on providing relief from pain and other symptoms of a serious illness. Palliative care specialists work with you, your family and your other doctors to provide an extra layer of support that complements your ongoing care. When palliative care is used along with all of the other appropriate treatments, people with cancer may feel better and live longer. Palliative care is provided by a team of doctors, nurses and other specially trained professionals. Palliative care teams aim to improve the quality of life for people with cancer and their families. This form of care is offered alongside curative or other treatments you may be receiving.\",\n          \"Tay-Sachs disease (Treatment): There is no cure for Tay-Sachs disease, but some treatments can help in managing symptoms. The goal of treatment is support and comfort. Supportive treatments include: - Medication. To reduce your child's symptoms, a number of prescription medications are available, including anti-seizure medications. - Respiratory care. Children who have Tay-Sachs disease are at high risk of lung infections that cause breathing problems and frequently accumulate mucus in their lungs. Your child may need the mucus using chest physiotherapy (CPT) to help remove mucus from the lungs. - Feeding tubes. Your child may have trouble swallowing, or develop respiratory problems by inhaling food or liquid into the lungs while eating. To prevent those problems, your doctor may recommend an assistive feeding device such as a gastrostomy tube, which is inserted through your child's nose and goes to your child's stomach. Or, a doctor trained in stomach surgery may surgically insert an esophagogastrostomy tube. - Physical therapy. As the disease progresses, your child may benefit from physical therapy to help keep joints flexible and maintain as much ability to move (range of motion) as possible. Physical therapy can delay joint stiffness and reduce or delay the loss of function and pain that can result from shortened muscles. Potential future treatments Gene therapy or enzyme replacement therapy research may eventually lead to a cure or treatment to slow the progression of Tay-Sachs disease.\",\n          \"Scoliosis in Children and Adolescents (How is it treated?): Your doctor may recommend the following treatments: - Observation. If the curve is mild and you are still growing, your doctor will re-examine you every few months. - Bracing. If the curve is moderate and you are still growing, your doctor may recommend a brace to keep the curve from getting worse. Braces are selected for the specific curve problem and fitted to each patient. Braces must be worn every day for the full number of hours prescribed by the doctor. - Surgery. If you are still growing and have a severe curve that is getting worse, your doctor may suggest surgery. This often involves fusing together two or more bones in the spine.

Many investigators believe MS to be an autoimmune disease -- one in which the body, through its immune system, launches a defensive attack against its own tissues. In the case of MS, it is the nerve-insulating myelin that comes under assault. Such assaults may be linked to an unknown environmental trigger, perhaps a virus. Most people experience their first symptoms of MS between the ages of 20 and 40; the initial symptom of MS is often blurred or double vision, red-green color distortion, or even blindness in one eye. Most MS patients experience muscle weakness in their extremities and difficulty with coordination and balance. These symptoms may be severe enough to impair walking or even standing. In the worst cases, MS can produce partial or complete paralysis. Most people with MS also exhibit paresthesias, transitory abnormal sensory feelings such as numbness, prickling, or \\\"pins and needles\\\" sensations. Some may also experience pain. Speech impediments, tremors, and dizziness are other frequent complaints. Occasionally, people with MS have hearing loss. Approximately half of all people with MS experience cognitive impairments such as difficulties with concentration, attention, memory, and poor judgment, but such symptoms are usually mild and are frequently overlooked. Depression is another common feature of MS. Treatment Currently there is no cure for MS. Many individuals do well with no therapy at all, especially since many medications have serious side effects and some carry significant risks. However, three forms of beta interferon (Avonex, Betaseron, and Rebif) have now been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for treatment of relapsing-remitting MS. The FDA has also approved ocrelizumab (brand name Ocrevus) to treat adults with relapsing forms of MS and primary progressive MS. Beta interferon has been shown to reduce the number of exacerbations and may slow the progression of physical disability. When attacks do occur, they tend to be shorter and less severe. The FDA also has approved a synthetic form of myelin basic protein, called copolymer I (Copaxone), for the treatment of relapsing-remitting MS. Copolymer I has few side effects, and studies indicate that the agent can reduce the relapse rate by almost one third. Other FDA approved drugs to treat relapsing forms of MS in adults include teriflunomide and dimethyl fumarate. An immunosuppressant treatment,Novantrone (mitoxantrone), is approved by the FDA for the treatment of advanced or chronic MS. The FDA has also approved dalfampridine (Ampyra) to improve walking in individuals with MS. One monoclonal antibody, natalizumab (Tysabri), was shown in clinical trials to significantly reduce the frequency of attacks in people with relapsing forms of MS and was approved for marketing by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2004. However, in 2005 the drug\\u2019s manufacturer voluntarily suspended marketing of the drug after several reports of significant adverse events. In 2006, the FDA again approved sale of the drug for MS but under strict treatment guidelines involving infusion centers where patients can be monitored by specially trained physicians. While steroids do not affect the course of MS over time, they can reduce the duration and severity of attacks in some patients. Spasticity, which can occur either as a sustained stiffness caused by increased muscle tone or as spasms that come and go, is usually treated with muscle relaxants and tranquilizers such as baclofen, tizanidine, diazepam, clonazepam, and dantrolene. Physical therapy and exercise can help preserve remaining function, and patients may find that various aids -- such as foot braces, canes, and walkers -- can help them remain independent and mobile. Avoiding excessive activity and avoiding heat are probably the most important measures patients can take to counter physiological fatigue. If psychological symptoms of fatigue such as depression or apathy are evident, antidepressant medications may help. Other drugs that may reduce fatigue in some, but not all, patients include amantadine (Symmetrel), pemoline (Cylert), and the still-experimental drug aminopyridine. Although improvement of optic symptoms usually occurs even without treatment, a short course of treatment with intravenous methylprednisolone (Solu-Medrol) followed by treatment with oral steroids is sometimes used. Prognosis A physician may diagnose MS in some patients soon after the onset of the illness. In others, however, doctors may not be able to readily identify the cause of the symptoms, leading to years of uncertainty and multiple diagnoses punctuated by baffling symptoms that mysteriously wax and wane. The vast majority of patients are mildly affected, but in the worst cases, MS can render a person unable to write, speak, or walk. MS is a disease with a natural tendency to remit spontaneously, for which there is no universally effective treatment. \",\n          \" Generalized anxiety disorder Overview It's normal to feel anxious from time to time, especially if your life is stressful. However, excessive, ongoing anxiety and worry that are difficult to control and interfere with day-to-day activities may be a sign of generalized anxiety disorder. It's possible to develop generalized anxiety disorder as a child or an adult. Generalized anxiety disorder has symptoms that are similar to panic disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder and other types of anxiety, but they're all different conditions. Living with generalized anxiety disorder can be a long-term challenge. In many cases, it occurs along with other anxiety or mood disorders. In most cases, generalized anxiety disorder improves with psychotherapy or medications. Making lifestyle changes, learning coping skills and using relaxation techniques also can help. Generalized anxiety disorder care at Mayo Clinic Symptoms Generalized anxiety disorder symptoms can vary. They may include: - Persistent worrying or anxiety about a number of areas that are out of proportion to the impact of the events - Overthinking plans and solutions to all possible worst-case outcomes - Perceiving situations and events as threatening, even when they aren't - Difficulty handling uncertainty - Indecisiveness and fear of making the wrong decision - Inability to set aside or let go of a worry - Inability to relax, feeling restless, and feeling keyed up or on edge - Difficulty concentrating, or the feeling that your mind \\\"goes blank\\\" Physical signs and symptoms may include: - Fatigue - Trouble sleeping - Muscle tension or muscle aches - Trembling, feeling twitchy - Nervousness or being easily startled - Sweating - Nausea, diarrhea or irritable bowel syndrome - Irritability There may be times when your worries don't completely consume you, but you still feel anxious even when there's no apparent reason. For example, you may feel intense worry about your safety or that of your loved ones, or you may have a general sense that something bad is about to happen. Your anxiety, worry or physical symptoms cause you significant distress in social, work or other areas of your life. Worries can shift from one concern to another and may change with time and age. Children and teenagers may have similar worries to adults, but also may have excessive worries about: - Performance at school or sporting events - Family members' safety - Being on time (punctuality) - Earthquakes, nuclear war or other catastrophic events A child or teen with excessive worry may: - Feel overly anxious to fit in - Be a perfectionist - Redo tasks because they aren't perfect the first time - Spend excessive time doing homework - Lack confidence - Strive for approval - Require a lot of reassurance about performance - Have frequent stomachaches or other physical complaints - Avoid going to school or avoid social situations Some anxiety is normal, but see your doctor if: - You feel like you're worrying too much, and it's interfering with your work, relationships or other parts of your life - You feel depressed or irritable, have trouble with drinking or drugs, or you have other mental health concerns along with anxiety - You have suicidal thoughts or behaviors - seek emergency treatment immediately Your worries are unlikely to simply go away on their own, and they may actually get worse over time. Try to seek professional help before your anxiety becomes severe - it may be easier to treat early on. Causes As with many mental health conditions, the cause of generalized anxiety disorder likely arises from a complex interaction of biological and environmental factors, which may include: - Differences in brain chemistry and function - Genetics - Differences in the way threats are perceived - Development and personality Risk factors Women are diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder somewhat more often than men are. The following factors may increase the risk of developing generalized anxiety disorder: - Personality. A person whose temperament is timid or negative or who avoids anything dangerous may be more prone to generalized anxiety disorder than others are. - Genetics. Generalized anxiety disorder may run in families. - Experiences. People with generalized anxiety disorder may have a history of significant life changes, traumatic or negative experiences during childhood, or a recent traumatic or negative event. Chronic medical illnesses or other mental health disorders may increase risk. Complications Having generalized anxiety disorder can be disabling. It can: - Impair your ability to perform tasks quickly and efficiently because you have trouble concentrating - Take your time and focus from other activities - Sap your energy - Increase your risk of depression Generalized anxiety disorder can also lead to or worsen other physical health conditions, such as: - Digestive or bowel problems, such as irritable bowel syndrome or ulcers - Headaches and migraines - Chronic pain and illness - Sleep problems and insomnia - Heart-health issues Generalized anxiety disorder often occurs along with other mental health problems, which can make diagnosis and treatment more challenging. Some mental health disorders that commonly occur with generalized anxiety disorder include: - Phobias - Panic disorder - Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) - Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) - Depression - Suicidal thoughts or suicide - Substance abuse Diagnosis To help diagnose generalized anxiety disorder, your doctor or mental health professional may: - Do a physical exam to look for signs that your anxiety might be linked to medications or an underlying medical condition - Order blood or urine tests or other tests, if a medical condition is suspected - Ask detailed questions about your symptoms and medical history - Use psychological questionnaires to help determine a diagnosis - Use the criteria listed in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), published by the American Psychiatric Association Treatment Treatment decisions are based on how significantly generalized anxiety disorder is affecting your ability to function in your daily life. The two main treatments for generalized anxiety disorder are psychotherapy and medications. You may benefit most from a combination of the two. It may take some trial and error to discover which treatments work best for you. Psychotherapy Also known as talk therapy or psychological counseling, psychotherapy involves working with a therapist to reduce your anxiety symptoms. Cognitive behavioral therapy is the most effective form of psychotherapy for generalized anxiety disorder. Generally a short-term treatment, cognitive behavioral therapy focuses on teaching you specific skills to directly manage your worries and help you gradually return to the activities you've avoided because of anxiety. Through this process, your symptoms improve as you build on your initial success. Medications Several types of medications are used to treat generalized anxiety disorder, including those below. Talk with your doctor about benefits, risks and possible side effects. - Antidepressants. Antidepressants, including medications in the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) and serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) classes, are the first line medication treatments. Examples of antidepressants used to treat generalized anxiety disorder include escitalopram (Lexapro), duloxetine (Cymbalta), venlafaxine (Effexor XR) and paroxetine (Paxil, Pexeva). Your doctor also may recommend other antidepressants. - Buspirone. An anti-anxiety medication called buspirone may be used on an ongoing basis. As with most antidepressants, it typically takes up to several weeks to become fully effective. - Benzodiazepines. In limited circumstances, your doctor may prescribe a benzodiazepine for relief of anxiety symptoms. These sedatives are generally used only for relieving acute anxiety on a short-term basis. Because they can be habit-forming, these medications aren't a good choice if you have or had problems with alcohol or drug abuse. Lifestyle and home remedies While most people with anxiety disorders need psychotherapy or medications to get anxiety under control, lifestyle changes also can make a difference. Here's what you can do: - Keep physically active. Develop a routine so that you're physically active most days of the week. Exercise is a powerful stress reducer. It may improve your mood and help you stay healthy. Start out slowly and gradually increase the amount and intensity of your activities. - Make sleep a priority. Do what you can to make sure you're getting enough sleep to feel rested. If you aren't sleeping well, see your doctor. - Use relaxation techniques. Visualization techniques, meditation and yoga are examples of relaxation techniques that can ease anxiety. - Eat healthy. Healthy eating - such as focusing on vegetables, fruits, whole grains and fish - may be linked to reduced anxiety, but more research is needed. - Avoid alcohol and recreational drugs. These substances can worsen anxiety. - Quit smoking and cut back or quit drinking coffee. Both nicotine and caffeine can worsen anxiety. Alternative medicine Several herbal remedies have been studied as treatments for anxiety. Results tend to be mixed, and in several studies people report no benefits from their use. More research is needed to fully understand the risks and benefits. Some herbal supplements, such as kava and valerian, increase the risk of serious liver damage. Other supplements, such as passionflower or theanine, may have a calming effect, but they're often combined with other products so it's hard to tell whether they help with symptoms of anxiety. Before taking any herbal remedies or supplements, talk with your doctor to make sure they're safe and won't interact with any medications you take. \",\n          \" Celiac disease - sprue Sprue Nontropical sprue Gluten intolerance Gluten-sensitive enteropathy Summary Celiac disease is a condition caused by damage to the lining of the small intestine. This damage comes from a reaction to eating gluten. This is a substance that is found in wheat, rye, barley, and possibly oats. It is also found in food made from these ingredients. The damaged intestine is not able to absorb nutrients from food. Causes The exact cause of celiac disease is not known. The lining of the intestines have small areas called villi which project outward into the opening of the intestine. These structures help absorb nutrients. When people with celiac disease eat foods with gluten, their immune system reacts by damaging the villi. Because of the damage, the villi are unable to properly absorb iron, vitamins, and other nutrients. This may cause a number of symptoms and other health problems. The disease can develop at any point in life, from infancy to late adulthood. People who have a family member with celiac disease are at greater risk of developing the disease. The disorder is most common in Europeans. Women are affected more often than men. People with celiac disease are more likely to have: Autoimmune disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, and Sjogren syndrome Addison disease Down syndrome Intestinal cancer Intestinal lymphoma Lactose intolerance Thyroid disease Type 1 diabetes Symptoms The symptoms of celiac disease can be different from person to person. This can make diagnosis difficult. For example, one person may have constipation, a second may have diarrhea, and a third may have no problem with stools. Gastrointestinal symptoms include: Abdominal pain, bloating, gas, or indigestion Constipation Decreased appetite (may also be increased or unchanged) Diarrhea, either constant or off and on Lactose intolerance (common when the person is diagnosed, often goes away after treatment) Nausea and vomiting Stools that are foul smelling, oily, or stick to the toilet when flushed Unexplained weight loss (although people can be overweight or normal weight) Other problems that can develop over time because the intestines do not absorb key nutrients include: Easy bruising Depression or anxiety Fatigue Growth delay in children Hair loss Itchy skin with a rash (dermatitis herpetiformis) Missed menstrual periods Mouth ulcers Muscle cramps and joint pain Nosebleeds Seizures Tingling or numbness in the hands or feet Unexplained short height Children with celiac disease may have: Defects in the tooth enamel and changes in tooth color Delayed puberty Muscle wasting Diarrhea, constipation, fatty or foul-smelling stools, nausea, or vomiting Irritable and fussy behavior Poor weight gain Slowed growth and shorter than normal height for their age Exams and Tests The following tests may be performed: Bone density Cholesterol (may be low) Complete blood count (CBC - test for anemia) Comprehensive metabolic panel Folate level (serum) Iron level (serum) Ferritin level Prothrombin time Vitamin B12 level (serum) Vitamin D level Blood tests can detect antibodies, called antitissue transglutaminase antibodies (tTGA) or anti-endomysial antibodies (EMA) which may help detect the condition. The health care provider will order these antibody tests if celiac disease is suspected. If the tests are positive, upper endoscopy is often performed to sample a piece of tissue (biopsy) from the first part of the small intestine (duodenum). The biopsy may show a flattening or loss of the villi in the parts of the intestine affected in the duodenum. Genetic testing of the blood can also be done to help detect who may be at risk for celiac disease. Those who test negative for the common genetic variant are unlikely to have celiac disease. A follow-up biopsy or blood test may be ordered several months after the diagnosis and treatment. These tests assess how well treatment is working. Normal results mean that you have responded to treatment. This confirms the diagnosis. However, this does not mean that the disease has been cured. Treatment Celiac disease cannot be cured. Your symptoms will go away and the villi in the intestines will heal if you follow a lifelong gluten-free diet. Do not eat foods, drink beverages, or take medicines that contain wheat, barley, rye, and possibly oats. You must read food and drug labels carefully to look ingredients that may include these grains. It may be hard to stick to a gluten-free diet because wheat and barley grains are common in the American diet. Over time, most people are able to adapt and get better. You should NOT begin the gluten-free diet before you are diagnosed. Starting the diet will affect testing for the disease. In most cases, following a well-balanced, gluten-free diet is the only treatment you need to stay well. Your health care provider may need to prescribe vitamin and mineral supplements. Sometimes, short-term use of corticosteroids (such as prednisone) may be needed if sprue does not respond to treatment. When you are diagnosed, get help from a registered dietitian who specializes in celiac disease and the gluten-free diet. A support group may also help you cope with the disease and diet. Outlook (Prognosis) Following a gluten-free diet heals the damage to the intestines and prevents further damage. This healing most often occurs within 3 to 6 months in children. Recovery may take 2 to 3 years in adults. Rarely, long-term damage will be done to the lining of the intestines before the diagnosis is made. Some problems caused by celiac disease may not improve, such as a short height and damage to the teeth. Possible Complications You must carefully continue to follow the gluten-free diet. When untreated, the disease can cause fatal complications. Delaying diagnosis or not following the diet puts you at risk for related conditions such as: Autoimmune disorders Bone disease (osteoporosis, kyphoscoliosis, fractures) Certain types of intestinal cancer Low blood count (anemia) Infertility or repeated miscarriage Liver disease When to Contact a Medical Professional Call your provider if you have symptoms of celiac disease. Prevention Because the exact cause is not known, there is no way to prevent the development of celiac disease. However, you should try to be aware of the risk factors such as family history. This may increase your chances of early diagnosis and treatment. Review Date 1/12/2018 Updated by: Michael M.

The kidneys normally filter fluid and waste products from the body and remove them in urine. in people with distal renal tubular acidosis, the kidneys are unable to remove enough acid from the body, and the blood becomes too acidic. This chemical imbalance is called metabolic acidosis. The inability to remove acids from the body often results in slowed growth and may also lead to softening and weakening of the bones, called rickets in children and osteomalacia in adults. This bone disorder is characterized by bone pain, bowed legs, and difficulty walking. In addition, most children and adults with SLC4A1-associated distal renal tubular acidosis have excess calcium in the urine (hypercalciuria), calcium deposits in the kidneys (nephrocalcinosis), and kidney stones (nephrolithiasis). In rare cases, these kidney abnormalities lead to life-threatening kidney failure. Affected individuals may also have low levels of potassium in the blood (hypokalemia). Individuals with the features described above have complete distal renal tubular acidosis, which usually becomes apparent in childhood. Some people do not develop metabolic acidosis even though their kidneys have trouble removing acids; these individuals are said to have incomplete distal renal tubular acidosis.

Often, people who initially have incomplete distal renal tubular acidosis develop metabolic acidosis later in life. Some people with SLC4A1-associated distal renal tubular acidosis also have blood cell abnormalities. These can vary in severity from no symptoms to a condition called hemolytic anemia, in which red blood cells prematurely break down (undergo hemolysis), causing a shortage of red blood cells (anemia).

Researchers believe that fibromyalgia amplifies painful sensations by affecting the way your brain processes pain signals. Symptoms sometimes begin after a physical trauma, surgery, infection or significant psychological stress. In other cases, symptoms gradually accumulate over time with no single triggering event. Women are more likely to develop fibromyalgia than are men. Many people who have fibromyalgia also have tension headaches, temporomandibular joint (TMJ) disorders, irritable bowel syndrome, anxiety and depression. While there is no cure for fibromyalgia, a variety of medications can help control symptoms. Exercise, relaxation and stress-reduction measures also may help. Symptoms of fibromyalgia include: - Widespread pain. The pain associated with fibromyalgia often is described as a constant dull ache that has lasted for at least three months. To be considered widespread, the pain must occur on both sides of your body and above and below your waist.   - Fatigue. People with fibromyalgia often awaken tired, even though they report sleeping for long periods of time. Sleep is often disrupted by pain, and many patients with fibromyalgia have other sleep disorders, such as restless legs syndrome and sleep apnea.   - Cognitive difficulties. A symptom commonly referred to as \\\"fibro fog\\\" impairs the ability to focus, pay attention and concentrate on mental tasks. Fibromyalgia often co-exists with other painful conditions, such as: - Irritable bowel syndrome   - Migraine and other types of headaches   - Interstitial cystitis or painful bladder syndrome   - Temporomandibular joint disorders Doctors don't know what causes fibromyalgia, but it most likely involves a variety of factors working together. These may include: - Genetics. Because fibromyalgia tends to run in families, there may be certain genetic mutations that may make you more susceptible to developing the disorder.   - Infections. Some illnesses appear to trigger or aggravate fibromyalgia.   - Physical or emotional trauma. Fibromyalgia can sometimes be triggered by a physical trauma, such as a car accident. Psychological stress may also trigger the condition. Why does it hurt? Researchers believe repeated nerve stimulation causes the brains of people with fibromyalgia to change. This change involves an abnormal increase in levels of certain chemicals in the brain that signal pain (neurotransmitters). In addition, the brain's pain receptors seem to develop a sort of memory of the pain and become more sensitive, meaning they can overreact to pain signals. Risk factors for fibromyalgia include: - Your sex. Fibromyalgia is diagnosed more often in women than in men.   - Family history. You may be more likely to develop fibromyalgia if a relative also has the condition.   - Other disorders. If you have osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis or lupus, you may be more likely to develop fibromyalgia. In the past, doctors would check 18 specific points on a person's body to see how many of them were painful when pressed firmly. Newer guidelines don't require a tender point exam. Instead, a fibromyalgia diagnosis can be made if a person has had widespread pain for more than three months - with no underlying medical condition that could cause the pain. Blood tests While there is no lab test to confirm a diagnosis of fibromyalgia, your doctor may want to rule out other conditions that may have similar symptoms. Blood tests may include: - Complete blood count - Erythrocyte sedimentation rate - Cyclic citrullinated peptide test - Rheumatoid factor - Thyroid function tests In general, treatments for fibromyalgia include both medication and self-care. The emphasis is on minimizing symptoms and improving general health. No one treatment works for all symptoms. Medications Medications can help reduce the pain of fibromyalgia and improve sleep. Common choices include: - Pain relievers. Over-the-counter pain relievers such as acetaminophen (Tylenol, others), ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, others) or naproxen sodium (Aleve, others) may be helpful. Your doctor might suggest a prescription pain reliever such as tramadol (Ultram). Narcotics are not advised, because they can lead to dependence and may even worsen the pain over time. - Antidepressants. Duloxetine (Cymbalta) and milnacipran (Savella) may help ease the pain and fatigue associated with fibromyalgia. Your doctor may prescribe amitriptyline or the muscle relaxant cyclobenzaprine to help promote sleep. - Anti-seizure drugs. Medications designed to treat epilepsy are often useful in reducing certain types of pain. Gabapentin (Neurontin) is sometimes helpful in reducing fibromyalgia symptoms, while pregabalin (Lyrica) was the first drug approved by the Food and Drug Administration to treat fibromyalgia. Therapy A variety of different therapies can help reduce the effect that fibromyalgia has on your body and your life. Examples include: - Physical therapy. A physical therapist can teach you exercises that will improve your strength, flexibility and stamina. Water-based exercises might be particularly helpful. - Occupational therapy. An occupational therapist can help you make adjustments to your work area or the way you perform certain tasks that will cause less stress on your body. - Counseling. Talking with a counselor can help strengthen your belief in your abilities and teach you strategies for dealing with stressful situations. Self-care is critical in the management of fibromyalgia. - Reduce stress. Develop a plan to avoid or limit overexertion and emotional stress. Allow yourself time each day to relax. That may mean learning how to say no without guilt. But try not to change your routine completely. People who quit work or drop all activity tend to do worse than do those who remain active. Try stress management techniques, such as deep-breathing exercises or meditation. - Get enough sleep. Because fatigue is one of the main characteristics of fibromyalgia, getting sufficient sleep is essential. In addition to allotting enough time for sleep, practice good sleep habits, such as going to bed and getting up at the same time each day and limiting daytime napping. - Exercise regularly. At first, exercise may increase your pain. But doing it gradually and regularly often decreases symptoms. Appropriate exercises may include walking, swimming, biking and water aerobics. A physical therapist can help you develop a home exercise program. Stretching, good posture and relaxation exercises also are helpful. - Pace yourself. Keep your activity on an even level. If you do too much on your good days, you may have more bad days. Moderation means not overdoing it on your good days, but likewise it means not self-limiting or doing too little on the days when symptoms flare. - Maintain a healthy lifestyle. Eat healthy foods. Limit your caffeine intake. Do something that you find enjoyable and fulfilling every day. Complementary and alternative therapies for pain and stress management aren't new. Some, such as meditation and yoga, have been practiced for thousands of years. But their use has become more popular in recent years, especially with people who have chronic illnesses, such as fibromyalgia. Several of these treatments do appear to safely relieve stress and reduce pain, and some are gaining acceptance in mainstream medicine. But many practices remain unproved because they haven't been adequately studied. - Acupuncture. Acupuncture is a Chinese medical system based on restoring normal balance of life forces by inserting very fine needles through the skin to various depths. According to Western theories of acupuncture, the needles cause changes in blood flow and levels of neurotransmitters in the brain and spinal cord. Some studies indicate that acupuncture helps relieve fibromyalgia symptoms, while others show no benefit. - Massage therapy. This is one of the oldest methods of health care still in practice. It involves use of different manipulative techniques to move your body's muscles and soft tissues. Massage can reduce your heart rate, relax your muscles, improve range of motion in your joints and increase production of your body's natural painkillers. It often helps relieve stress and anxiety. - Yoga and tai chi. These practices combine meditation, slow movements, deep breathing and relaxation. Both have been found to be helpful in controlling fibromyalgia symptoms.\",\n          \"Pulmonary Hypertension (Causes): Pulmonary hypertension (PH) begins with inflammation and changes in the cells that line your pulmonary arteries. Other factors also can affect the pulmonary arteries and cause PH. For example, the condition may develop if: The walls of the arteries tighten. The walls of the arteries are stiff at birth or become stiff from an overgrowth of cells. Blood clots form in the arteries. These changes make it hard for your heart to push blood through your pulmonary arteries and into your lungs. Thus, the pressure in the arteries rises, causing PH. Many factors can contribute to the process that leads to the different types of PH. Group 1 pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) may have no known cause, or the condition may be inherited. (\\\"Inherited\\\" means the condition is passed from parents to children through genes.) Some diseases and conditions also can cause group 1 PAH. Examples include HIV infection, congenital heart disease, and sickle cell disease. Also, the use of street drugs (such as cocaine) and certain diet medicines can lead to PAH. Many diseases and conditions can cause groups 2 through 5 PH (often called secondary PH), including: Mitral valve disease Lung diseases, such as COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) Sleep apnea Sarcoidosis For more information about the types of PH and the diseases, conditions, and factors that can cause them, go to \\\"Types of Pulmonary Hypertension.\\\"\",\n          \"Rhinoplasty: Rhinoplasty is surgery to repair or reshape the nose.

It is performed in a surgeon's office, a hospital, or an outpatient surgery center. Complex procedures may require a short hospital stay. The procedure often takes 1 to 2 hours. It may take longer.   With local anesthesia, the nose and the area around it are numbed. You will probably be lightly sedated, but awake during the surgery (relaxed and not feeling pain). General anesthesia allows you to sleep through the operation.   The surgery is usually done through a cut (incision) made inside the nostrils. In some cases, the cut is made from outside, around the base of the nose. This type of cut is used to perform work on the tip of the nose or if you need a cartilage graft. If the nose needs to be narrowed, the incision may extend around the nostrils. Small incisions may be made on the side of the nose to break, and reshape the bone.   A splint (metal or plastic) may be placed on the outside of the nose. This helps maintain the new shape of the bone when the surgery is finished. Soft plastic splints or nasal packs also may be placed in the nostrils. This helps keep the dividing wall between the air passages (septum) stable. Rhinoplasty is one of the most common plastic surgery procedures. It can be used to:     - Reduce or increase the size of the nose   - Change the shape of the tip or the nasal bridge   - Narrow the opening of the nostrils   - Change the angle between the nose and the upper lip   - Correct a birth defect or injury   - Help relieve some breathing problems      Nose surgery is considered elective when it is done for cosmetic reasons. In these cases, the purpose is to change the shape of the nose to one that the person finds more desirable. Many surgeons prefer to perform cosmetic nose surgery after the nasal bone has finished growing. This is around age 14 or 15 for girls and a bit later for boys. Risks for anesthesia and surgery in general are:     - Reactions to medicines, problems breathing   - Bleeding, infection, or bruising      Risks for this procedure include:     - Loss of support of the nose   - Contour deformities of the nose   - Need for further surgery     After surgery, tiny blood vessels that have burst may appear as tiny red spots on the skin surface. These are usually minor, but are permanent. There are no visible scars if the rhinoplasty is performed from inside the nose. If the procedure narrows flared nostrils, there may be small scars at the base of the nose that are not often visible.   In rare cases, a second procedure is needed to fix a minor deformity. Your surgeon may give you instructions to follow before your surgery. You may need to:     - Stop any medicines that thin your blood. Your surgeon will give you a list of these medicines.   - See your regular health care provider to have some routine tests and make sure it is safe for you to have surgery.   - To aid with healing, stop smoking 2 to 3 weeks before and after surgery.   - Arrange to have someone drive you home after surgery. You will usually go home on the same day as your surgery.   Right after surgery, your nose and face will be swollen and painful. Headaches are common.   The nasal packing is usually removed in 3 to 5 days, after which you will feel more comfortable.   The splint may be left in place for 1 to 2 weeks. Full recovery takes several weeks.   Healing is a slow and gradual process. The tip of the nose may have some swelling and numbness for months. You may not be able to see the final results for up to a year. Updated by: David A.

It is a descriptive term for a collection of symptoms that can be caused by a number of disorders that affect the brain. People with dementia have significantly impaired intellectual functioning that interferes with normal activities and relationships. They also lose their ability to solve problems and maintain emotional control, and they may experience personality changes and behavioral problems, such as agitation, delusions, and hallucinations. While memory loss is a common symptom of dementia, memory loss by itself does not mean that a person has dementia. Doctors diagnose dementia only if two or more brain functions - such as memory and language skills -- are significantly impaired without loss of consciousness. Some of the diseases that can cause symptoms of dementia are Alzheimer\\u2019s disease, vascular dementia, Lewy body dementia, frontotemporal dementia, Huntington\\u2019s disease, and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. Doctors have identified other conditions that can cause dementia or dementia-like symptoms including reactions to medications, metabolic problems and endocrine abnormalities, nutritional deficiencies, infections, poisoning, brain tumors, anoxia or hypoxia (conditions in which the brain\\u2019s oxygen supply is either reduced or cut off entirely), and heart and lung problems. Although it is common in very elderly individuals, dementia is not a normal part of the aging process. Treatment Drugs to specifically treat Alzheimer\\u2019s disease and some other progressive dementias are now available. Although these drugs do not halt the disease or reverse existing brain damage, they can improve symptoms and slow the progression of the disease. This may improve an individual\\u2019s quality of life, ease the burden on caregivers, or delay admission to a nursing home. Many researchers are also examining whether these drugs may be useful for treating other types of dementia. Many people with dementia, particularly those in the early stages, may benefit from practicing tasks designed to improve performance in specific aspects of cognitive functioning. For example, people can sometimes be taught to use memory aids, such as mnemonics, computerized recall devices, or note taking. Prognosis There are many disorders that can cause dementia. Some, such as Alzheimer\\u2019s disease or Huntington\\u2019s disease, lead to a progressive loss of mental functions. But other types of dementia can be halted or reversed with appropriate treatment. People with moderate or advanced dementia typically need round-the-clock care and supervision to prevent them from harming themselves or others. They also may need assistance with daily activities such as eating, bathing, and dressing. \",\n          \" Best vitelliform macular dystrophy Best disease Best macular dystrophy Macular degeneration, polymorphic vitelline Best disease Best macular dystrophy Macular degeneration, polymorphic vitelline Vitelliform macular dystrophy type 2 VMD2 BVMD Early-onset vitelliform macular dystrophy Juvenile-onset vitelliform macular dystrophy Polymorphic vitelline macular degeneration See More Summary Best vitelliform macular dystrophy (BVMD) is a slowly progressive form of macular degeneration. It usually begins in childhood or adolescence, but age of onset and severity of vision loss can vary. Affected people first have normal vision, followed by decreased central visual acuity and distorted vision (metamorphopsia). Peripheral vision is not affected. [1] BVMD is characterized by atrophy of the retinal pigment epithelium (The retina is the back part of the eye that contains the specialized cells that respond to light, known as photoreceptors) and impaired central visual function. [2] BVMD is usually inherited in an autosomal dominant manner, but autosomal recessive inheritance has been reported. The condition is typically caused by mutations in the BEST1 gene ; in a few cases the cause is unknown. Treatment is symptomatic and involves the use of low vision aids, and direct laser treatment or photodynamic therapy. Newer treatment includes anti-VEGF agents ( bevacizumab) and transcorneal electrical retinal stimulation. [1] Symptoms This table lists symptoms that people with this disease may have. For most diseases, symptoms will vary from person to person. People with the same disease may not have all the symptoms listed. This information comes from a database called the Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) . The HPO collects information on symptoms that have been described in medical resources. The HPO is updated regularly. Use the HPO ID to access more in-depth information about a symptom.

[1] This gene gives the body instructions for making a protein called bestrophin. Bestrophin acts as a channel that controls the movement of chloride ions within the retina. It is thought that mutations in the BEST1 gene affect the shape of the channel and its ability to properly regulate the flow of chloride. However, it is unclear how exactly this relates to the specific features of BVMD. [3] Inheritance Best vitelliform macular dystrophy (BVMD) is most commonly inherited in an autosomal dominant manner, although a few cases with autosomal recessive inheritance have been reported. [1] In autosomal dominant inheritance, having one changed ( mutated ) copy of the responsible gene in each cell is enough to cause symptoms of the condition. When a person with an autosomal dominant condition has children, each child has a 50% (1 in 2) chance to inherit the mutated gene. Most people with BVMD have an affected parent, but some people have the condition as the result of a new mutation that occurred for the first time. [1] Autosomal recessive inheritance means that a person must have a mutation in both copies of the responsible gene in each cell to be affected. The parents of an affected person usually each carry one mutated copy of the gene and are referred to as carriers . Carriers typically do not show signs or symptoms of the condition. When two carriers of an autosomal recessive condition have children, each child has a 25% (1 in 4) risk to have the condition, a 50% (1 in 2) risk to be a carrier like each of the parents, and a 25% chance to not have the condition and not be a carrier. Diagnosis Best vitelliform macular dystrophy (BVMD) may be diagnosed based on the findings on an exam of the fundus (the interior surface of the eye opposite the lens); an electrooculogram (EOG); and the family history . An eye exam may include other tests as well. A fundus exam may show a typical yellow yolk-like macular lesion. The EOG, which reflects the retinal pigmentary epithelium function, is the most diagnostic test for evaluating vitelliform macular dystrophy. In the majority of the cases, a severe decrease occurs in light response, reflected by an Arden (light-peak/dark-trough) ratio of 1.1-1.5. (The normal Arden ratio is 1.8.) Carriers will also have an abnormal EOG result. No correlation exists between EOG result and disease stage, visual acuity, or patient age. EOG results are usually symmetric for both eyes. [4] The family history in affected people is often consistent with either autosomal dominant or autosomal recessive inheritance. [1] Genetic testing may also be used to make a diagnosis of BVMD. A BEST1 mutation is detected in about 96% of affected people who have an affected family member. In people with no family history of BVMD, the mutation detection rate ranges between 50-70%. A mutation in BEST1 gene is more probable when a vitelliform lesion is accompanied by a reduced Arden ratio on EOG testing. The exact type of genetic test ordered to confirm a diagnosis may depend on a person's ancestry, family history, and/or whether other eye disorders are also being considered. [1] Treatment There is no specific treatment for Best vitelliform macular dystrophy (BVMD) at this time. [5] [4] Low vision aids help affected people with significant loss of visual acuity. [6] Laser photocoagulation, photodynamic therapy, and anti-VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor) agents such as bevacizumab have shown limited success in treating some of the secondary features of BVMD such as choroidal neovascularization (when abnormal blood vessels grow under the macula and retina). [6] [5] [4] Find a Specialist If you need medical advice, you can look for doctors or other healthcare professionals who have experience with this disease. You may find these specialists through advocacy organizations, clinical trials, or articles published in medical journals. You may also want to contact a university or tertiary medical center in your area, because these centers tend to see more complex cases and have the latest technology and treatments. If you can't find a specialist in your local area, try contacting national or international specialists. They may be able to refer you to someone they know through conferences or research efforts. Some specialists may be willing to consult with you or your local doctors over the phone or by email if you can't travel to them for care. You can find more tips in our guide, How to Find a Disease Specialist. We also encourage you to explore the rest of this page to find resources that can help you find specialists.

Considerations A fractured nose is the most common fracture of the face. It most often occurs after an injury and often occurs with other fractures of the face. Nose injuries and neck injuries are often seen together. A blow that is forceful enough to injure the nose may be hard enough to injure the neck. Serious nose injuries cause problems that need a health care provider's attention right away. For example, damage to the cartilage can cause a collection of blood to form inside the nose. If this blood is not drained right away, it can cause an abscess or a permanent deformity that blocks the nose. It may lead to tissue death and cause the nose to collapse. For minor nose injuries, the provider may want to see the person within the first week after the injury to see if the nose has moved out of its normal shape. Sometimes, surgery may be needed to correct a nose or septum that has been bent out of shape by an injury. Symptoms Symptoms may include: Blood coming from the nose Bruising around the eyes Difficulty breathing through the nose Misshapen appearance (may not be obvious until the swelling goes down) Pain Swelling The bruised appearance most often disappears after 2 weeks. First Aid If a nose injury happens: Try to stay calm. Breathe through your mouth and lean forward in a sitting position to keep blood from going down the back of your throat. Squeeze the nostrils closed and hold pressure to stop the bleeding. Apply cold compresses to your nose to reduce swelling. If possible, hold the compress so that there isn't too much pressure on the nose. To help relieve pain, try acetaminophen (Tylenol). DO NOT DO NOT try to straighten a broken nose DO NOT move the person if there is reason to suspect a head or neck injury When to Contact a Medical Professional Get medical help right away if: Bleeding will not stop Clear fluid keeps draining from the nose You suspect a blood clot in the septum You suspect a neck or head injury The nose looks deformed or out of its usual shape The person is having difficulty breathing Prevention Wear protective headgear while playing contact sports, or riding bicycles, skateboards, roller skates, or rollerblades. Use seat belts and appropriate car seats when driving. Review Date 8/17/2016 Updated by: Josef Shargorodsky, MD, MPH, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD.

It belongs to the class of medicines known as benzodiazepines. Oxazepam overdose occurs when someone accidentally or intentionally takes too much of this medicine.  Benzodiazepines are the most common prescription drugs used in suicide attempts.  This is for information only and not for use in the treatment or management of an actual overdose. DO NOT use it to treat or manage an actual overdose. If you or someone you are with overdoses, call your local emergency number (such as 911), or your local poison center can be reached directly by calling the national toll-free Poison Help hotline (1-800-222-1222) from anywhere in the United States. Oxazepam: Oxazepam may increase the risk of serious or life-threatening breathing problems, sedation, or coma if used along with certain medications. Tell your doctor if you are taking or plan to take certain opiate medications for cough such as codeine (in Triacin-C, in Tuzistra XR) or hydrocodone (in Anexsia, in Norco, in Zyfrel) or for pain such as codeine (in Fiorinal), fentanyl (Actiq, Duragesic, Subsys, others), hydromorphone (Dilaudid, Exalgo), meperidine (Demerol), methadone (Dolophine, Methadose), morphine (Astramorph, Duramorph PF, Kadian), oxycodone (in Oxycet, in Percocet, in Roxicet, others), and tramadol (Conzip, Ultram, in Ultracet). Your doctor may need to change the dosages of your medications and will monitor you carefully. If you take oxazepam with any of these medications and you develop any of the following symptoms, call your doctor immediately or seek emergency medical care immediately: unusual dizziness, lightheadedness, extreme sleepiness, slowed or difficult breathing, or unresponsiveness. Be sure that your caregiver or family members know which symptoms may be serious so they can call the doctor or emergency medical care if you are unable to seek treatment on your own.   Drinking alcohol or using street drugs during your treatment with oxazepam also increases the risk that you will experience these serious, life-threatening side effects. Do not drink alcohol or use street drugs during your treatment. Oxazepam is used to relieve anxiety, including anxiety caused by alcohol withdrawal (symptoms that may develop in people who stop drinking alcohol after drinking large amounts for a long time). Oxazepam is in a class of medications called benzodiazepines. It works by slowing activity in the brain to allow for relaxation. Oxazepam comes as a capsule to take by mouth. It is usually taken three or four times a day and may be taken with or without food. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take oxazepam exactly as directed.   Oxazepam can be habit-forming. Do not take a larger dose, take it more often, or take it for a longer time than prescribed by your doctor. Oxazepam may not work as well if it is taken for a long time.   Oxazepam may help control your symptoms but will not cure your condition. Continue to take oxazepam even if you feel well. Do not skip doses even if you feel that you do not need them. Do not stop taking this medication without talking to your doctor. If you suddenly stop taking oxazepam, you may experience withdrawal symptoms (anxiousness, sleeplessness, and irritability). Your doctor will probably decrease your dose gradually. Oxazepam is also used to treat irritable bowel syndrome. Talk to your doctor about the possible risks of using this medication for your condition.   This medication may be prescribed for other uses. Ask your doctor or pharmacist for more information. Before taking oxazepam,     - tell your doctor and pharmacist if you are allergic to oxazepam, any other medications, or any of the ingredients in oxazepam capsules. Ask your doctor or pharmacist for more information.   - tell your doctor and pharmacist what prescription and nonprescription medications, vitamins, nutritional supplements, and herbal products you are taking or plan to take. Be sure to mention any of the following: antihistamines; digoxin (Lanoxin); levodopa (in Ritary, in Sinemet, in Stalevo); medication for depression, seizures, Parkinson's disease, asthma, colds, or allergies; muscle relaxants; oral contraceptives; phenytoin (Dilantin, Phenytek); probenecid (Probalan, in Col-Probenecid); rifampin (Rifadin, Rimactane, in Rifamate, in Rifater); sedatives; sleeping pills; theophylline (Elixophyllin, Theo 24, Theochron); or tranquilizers. Your doctor may need to change the doses of your medications or monitor you carefully for side effects.   - tell your doctor if you have or have ever had glaucoma or seizures, or lung, heart, or liver disease.   - tell your doctor if you are pregnant, plan to become pregnant, or are breastfeeding. If you become pregnant while taking oxazepam, call your doctor immediately.   - talk to your doctor about the risks and benefits of taking oxazepam if you are 65 years of age or older. Older adults should take lower doses of oxazepam because higher doses may not be more effective and are more likely to cause serious side effects.    - if you are having surgery, including dental surgery, tell the doctor or dentist that you are taking oxazepam.   - you should know that this medication may make you drowsy. Do not drive a car or operate machinery until you know how this medication affects you.   - tell your doctor if you use tobacco products. Cigarette smoking may decrease the effectiveness of this medication. Unless your doctor tells you otherwise, continue your normal diet. Take the missed dose as soon as you remember it. However, if it is almost time for your next dose skip the missed dose and continue your regular dosing schedule. Do not take a double dose to make up for a missed one. Oxazepam may cause side effects. Call your doctor if any of the symptoms are severe or do not go away:      - drowsiness   - dizziness   - tiredness   - weakness   - dry mouth   - diarrhea   - upset stomach   - changes in appetite   - restlessness or excitement   - constipation   - difficulty urinating   - frequent urination   - blurred vision   - changes in sex drive or ability    Some side effects can be serious. If you experience any of the following symptoms, call your doctor immediately:      - shuffling walk   - persistent, fine tremor or inability to sit still   - fever   - difficulty breathing or swallowing   - severe skin rash   - yellowing of the skin or eyes   - irregular heartbeat     Oxazepam may cause other side effects. Call your doctor if you experience any unusual problems during your treatment with oxazepam.   If you experience a serious side effect, you or your doctor may send a report to the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) MedWatch Adverse Event Reporting program online (http://www.fda.gov/Safety/MedWatch) or by phone (1-800-332-1088). Keep this medication in the container it came in, tightly closed, and out of reach of children. Store it at room temperature and away from excess heat and moisture (not in the bathroom).    Unneeded medications should be disposed of in special ways to ensure that pets, children, and other people cannot consume them. However, you should not flush this medication down the toilet. Instead, the best way to dispose of your medication is through a medicine take-back program. Talk to your pharmacist or contact your local garbage/recycling department to learn about take-back programs in your community. See the FDA's Safe Disposal of Medicines website (http://goo.gl/c4Rm4p) for more information if you do not have access to a take-back program.   It is important to keep all medication out of sight and reach of children as many containers (such as weekly pill minders and those for eye drops, creams, patches, and inhalers) are not child-resistant and young children can open them easily. To protect young children from poisoning, always lock safety caps and immediately place the medication in a safe location \\u2013 one that is up and away and out of their sight and reach. http://www.upandaway.org In case of overdose, call your local poison control center at 1-800-222-1222. If the victim has collapsed or is not breathing, call local emergency services at 911. Keep all appointments with your doctor.   Do not let anyone else take your medication. Oxazepam is a controlled substance. Prescriptions may be refilled only a limited number of times; ask your pharmacist if you have any questions.   It is important for you to keep a written list of all of the prescription and nonprescription (over-the-counter) medicines you are taking, as well as any products such as vitamins, minerals, or other dietary supplements. You should bring this list with you each time you visit a doctor or if you are admitted to a hospital. It is also important information to carry with you in case of emergencies. - Serax\\u00ae\\u00b6 Oxazepam (In case of emergency/overdose): In case of overdose, call your local poison control center at 1-800-222-1222.

Dizziness that creates the false sense that you or your surroundings are spinning or moving is called vertigo. Dizziness is one of the more common reasons adults visit their doctors. Frequent dizzy spells or constant dizziness can significantly affect your life. But dizziness rarely signals a life-threatening condition. Treatment of dizziness depends on the cause and your symptoms. It's usually effective, but the problem may recur. People experiencing dizziness may describe it as any of a number of sensations, such as: - A false sense of motion or spinning (vertigo)   - Lightheadedness or feeling faint   - Unsteadiness or a loss of balance   - A feeling of floating, wooziness or heavy-headedness These feelings may be triggered or worsened by walking, standing up or moving your head. Your dizziness may accompanied by nausea or be so sudden or severe that you need to sit or lie down. The episode may last seconds or days and may recur. When to see a doctor Call 911 or seek emergency medical help if you experience dizziness with: - A sudden or severe headache   - Ongoing vomiting   - A sudden change in speech, vision or hearing   - Stumbling or difficulty walking   - Fainting   - Chest pain or an irregular heart rate   - Numbness or weakness   - Shortness of breath   - A high fever   - A very stiff neck   - A head injury   - Seizures Consult with your doctor if you experience recurrent, sudden, severe dizziness or prolonged episodes of dizziness, faintness, lightheadedness or vertigo. Dizziness has many possible causes, including inner ear disturbance, motion sickness and medication effects. Sometimes it's caused by an underlying health condition, such as poor circulation, infection or injury. The way dizziness makes you feel and your triggers provide clues for possible causes. How long the dizziness lasts and any other symptoms you have also help pinpoint the cause. Inner ear problems that cause dizziness (vertigo) Your sense of balance depends on the combined input from the various parts of your sensory system. These include your: - Eyes, which help you determine where your body is in space and how it's moving   - Sensory nerves, which send messages to your brain about body movements and positions   - Inner ear, which houses sensors that help detect gravity and back-and-forth motion Vertigo is the false sense that your surroundings are spinning or moving. With inner ear disorders, your brain receives signals from the inner ear that aren't consistent with what your eyes and sensory nerves are receiving. Vertigo is what results as your brain works to sort out the confusion. - Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV). This condition causes an intense and brief but false sense that you're spinning or moving. These episodes are triggered by a rapid change in head movement, such as when you turn over in bed, sit up or experience a blow to the head. BPPV is the most common cause of vertigo.   - Infection. A viral infection of the vestibular nerve, called vestibular neuritis, can cause intense, constant vertigo. If you also have sudden hearing loss, you may have labyrinthitis.   - Meniere's disease. This disease involves the excessive buildup of fluid in your inner ear. It's characterized by sudden episodes of vertigo lasting as long as several hours. You may also experience fluctuating hearing loss, ringing in the ear and the feeling of a plugged ear.   - Migraine. People who experience migraines may have episodes of vertigo or other types of dizziness even when they're not having a severe headache. Such vertigo episodes can last minutes to hours and may be associated with headache as well as light and noise sensitivity. Circulation problems that cause dizziness You may feel dizzy, faint or off balance if your heart isn't pumping enough blood to your brain. Causes include: - Drop in blood pressure. A dramatic drop in your systolic blood pressure - the higher number in your blood pressure reading - may result in brief lightheadedness or a feeling of faintness. It can occur after sitting up or standing too quickly. This condition is also called orthostatic hypotension.   - Poor blood circulation. Conditions such as cardiomyopathy, heart attack, heart arrhythmia and transient ischemic attack could cause dizziness. And a decrease in blood volume may cause inadequate blood flow to your brain or inner ear. Other causes of dizziness - Neurological conditions. Some neurological disorders - such as Parkinson's disease and multiple sclerosis - can lead to progressive loss of balance.   - Medications. Dizziness can be a side effect of certain medications - such as anti-seizure drugs, antidepressants, sedatives and tranquilizers. In particular, blood pressure lowering medications may cause faintness if they lower your blood pressure too much.   - Anxiety disorders. Certain anxiety disorders may cause lightheadedness or a woozy feeling often referred to as dizziness. These include panic attacks and a fear of leaving home or being in large, open spaces (agoraphobia).   - Low iron levels (anemia). Other signs and symptoms that may occur along with dizziness if you have anemia include fatigue, weakness and pale skin.   - Low blood sugar (hypoglycemia). This condition generally occurs in people with diabetes who use insulin. Dizziness (lightheadedness) may be accompanied by sweating and anxiety.   - Overheating and dehydration. If you're active in hot weather, or if you don't drink enough fluids, you may feel dizzy from overheating (hyperthermia) or from dehydration. This is especially true if you take certain heart medications. Factors that may increase your risk of getting dizzy include: - Age. Older adults are more likely to have medical conditions that cause dizziness, especially a sense of imbalance. They're also more likely to take medications that can cause dizziness.   - A past episode of dizziness. If you've experienced dizziness before, you're more likely to get dizzy in the future. If your doctor suspects you're having or may have had a stroke, are older or suffered a blow to the head, he or she may immediately order an MRI or CT scan. Most people visiting their doctor because of dizziness will first be asked about their symptoms and medications and then be given a physical examination. During this exam, your doctor will check how you walk and maintain your balance and how the major nerves of your central nervous system are working. You may also need a hearing test and balance tests, including: - Eye movement testing. Your doctor may watch the path of your eyes when you track a moving object. And you may be given an eye motion test in which cold and warm water or air are placed in your ear canal. - Head movement testing. If your doctor suspects your vertigo is caused by benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, he or she may do a simple head movement test called the Dix-Hallpike maneuver to verify the diagnosis. - Posturography. This test tells your doctor which parts of the balance system you rely on the most and which parts may be giving you problems. You stand in your bare feet on a platform and try to keep your balance under various conditions. - Rotary-chair testing. During this test you sit in a computer-controlled chair that moves very slowly in a full circle. At faster speeds, it moves back and forth in a very small arc. In addition, you may be given blood tests to check for infection and other tests to check heart and blood vessel health. Dizziness often gets better without treatment. Within a couple of weeks, the body usually adapts to whatever is causing it. If you seek treatment, your doctor will base it on the cause of your condition and your symptoms. It may include medications and balance exercises. Even if no cause is found or if your dizziness persists, prescription drugs and other treatments may make your symptoms more manageable. Medications - Water pills. If you have Meniere's disease, your doctor may prescribe a water pill (diuretic). This along with a low-salt diet may help reduce how often you have dizziness episodes. - Medications that reduce the dizziness. Antihistamines such as meclizine (Antivert) may offer short-term relief from vertigo. Anticholinergics help reduce dizziness. They include scopolamine skin patches (Transderm Scop). - Anti-nausea medications. Your doctor may prescribe a drug to provide immediate relief of nausea. Some of these can cause drowsiness. - Anti-anxiety medications. Diazepam (Valium) and alprazolam (Xanax) are in a class of drugs called benzodiazepines, which may cause addiction. They may also cause drowsiness. - Preventive medicine for migraine. Certain medicines may help prevent attacks of migraine. Therapy - Head position maneuvers. A technique called canalith repositioning (or Epley maneuver) usually helps resolve benign paroxysmal positional vertigo more quickly than simply waiting for your dizziness to go away. It can be done by your doctor, an audiologist or a physical therapist and involves maneuvering the position of your head. It's usually effective after one or two treatments. Before undergoing this procedure, tell your care provider if you have a neck or back condition, a detached retina or blood vessel problems. - Balance therapy. You may learn specific exercises to help make your balance system less sensitive to motion. This physical therapy technique is called vestibular rehabilitation. It is used for people with dizziness from inner ear conditions such as vestibular neuritis. - Psychotherapy. This type of therapy may help people whose dizziness is caused by anxiety disorders. Surgical or other procedures - Injections. Your doctor may inject your inner ear with the antibiotic gentamicin to disable the balance function. The unaffected ear takes over that function. - Removal of the inner ear sense organ. A procedure that's rarely used is called labyrinthectomy. It disables the vestibular labyrinth in the affected ear. The other ear takes over the balance function. This technique may be used if you have serious hearing loss and your dizziness hasn't responded to other treatments. Dizziness usually goes away on its own. If you tend to experience repeated episodes of dizziness, consider these tips: - Be aware of the possibility of losing your balance, which can lead to falling and serious injury. - Avoid moving suddenly and walk with a cane for stability, if needed. - Fall-proof your home by removing tripping hazards such as area rugs and exposed electrical cords. Use nonslip mats on your bath and shower floors. Use good lighting. - Sit or lie down immediately when you feel dizzy. Lie still with your eyes closed in a darkened room if you're experiencing a severe episode of vertigo. - Avoid driving a car or operating heavy machinery if you experience frequent dizziness without warning. - Avoid using caffeine, alcohol, salt and tobacco. Excessive use of these substances can worsen your signs and symptoms. - Drink enough fluids, eat a healthy diet, get enough sleep and avoid stress. - If your dizziness is caused by a medication, talk with your doctor about discontinuing it or lowering the dose. - If your dizziness comes with nausea, try an over-the-counter (nonprescription) antihistamine, such as meclizine (Antivert) or one containing dimenhydrinate (Dramamine). These may cause drowsiness. Nondrowsy antihistamines aren't as effective. - If your dizziness is caused by overheating or dehydration, rest in a cool place and drink water or a sports drink (Gatorade, Powerade, others). What is Macular Degeneration?: Macular degeneration, or age-related macular degeneration (AMD), is a leading cause of vision loss in Americans 60 and older. It is a disease that destroys your sharp, central vision. You need central vision to see objects clearly and to do tasks such as reading and driving.     AMD affects the macula, the part of the eye that allows you to see fine detail. It does not hurt, but it causes cells in the macula to die. There are two types: wet and dry. Wet AMD happens when abnormal blood vessels grow under the macula. These new blood vessels often leak blood and fluid. Wet AMD damages the macula quickly. Blurred vision is a common early symptom. Dry AMD happens when the light-sensitive cells in the macula slowly break down. Your gradually lose your central vision. A common early symptom is that straight lines appear crooked.    Regular comprehensive eye exams can detect macular degeneration before the disease causes vision loss. Treatment can slow vision loss. It does not restore vision.

It is possible to construct malicious pickle data which will execute arbitrary code during unpickling (See https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/main/SECURITY.md#untrusted-models for more details). In a future release, the default value for `weights_only` will be flipped to `True`. This limits the functions that could be executed during unpickling. Arbitrary objects will no longer be allowed to be loaded via this mode unless they are explicitly allowlisted by the user via `torch.serialization.add_safe_globals`.
